                    <p>Thank you very much, Ambassador, and it’s a great pleasure and privilege for
                        me to welcome all of you to the Department of State. I know we have in this
                        audience scholars and historians, diplomats, and those who have great
                        personal knowledge of and experience with the important issue that will be
                        discussed throughout the day. A lot of history has been made in the State
                        Department and continues to be made every day. And some of the people who
                        are working here and who have worked here previously know that very
                        well.</p>
                    <p>I want, personally, to welcome Secretary Henry Kissinger back to the State
                        Department, Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, Assistant Secretary Kurt Campbell,
                        and all of my colleagues who are engaged in the art of diplomacy in the 21st
                        century. I also want to offer a special word of welcome to our guests from
                        the Republic of Vietnam: Ambassador Tran Van Tung and Dr. Nguyen Manh Ha.
                        Thank you all for being here and thank you for participating in this
                        important dialogue. I see former Deputy Secretary John Negroponte. Thank you
                        for being here as well.</p>
                    <p>I want to acknowledge all of the hard work of the historians here at the
                        State Department who have completed an exhaustive record of United States
                        policy regarding Southeast Asia from 1946 until 1975. They have compiled
                        more than 24,000 pages of official documents, many thousands of messages,
                        memoranda, intelligence reports, military assessments, and transcripts of
                        meetings and telephone conversations among key policymakers. They did not,
                        at least, have to sort through millions of emails. (Laughter.) I’m afraid
                        we’re going to have to quadruple the size of the Historian’s Office for
                        future assessments. (Laughter.) This collection will be a resource for
                        students and scholars, for families and citizens in both of our countries
                        who remain keenly interested in this chapter of our shared history.</p>
                    <p>For Americans of my generation, the war in Vietnam shaped the way we view the
                        world and our country. Like everyone in those days, I had friends who
                        enlisted – male friends who enlisted – were drafted, resisted, or became
                        conscientious objectors; many long, painful, anguished conversations. And
                        yet, the lessons of that era continue to inform the decisions we make. And
                        for Vietnamese of the same generation who saw their country torn apart by
                        war and who shared also the anguish, the loss of loved ones, friends, and
                        family members as so many Americans did, the memories are also vivid and,
                        for many, still painful.</p>
                    <p>People do not easily shake off the weight of history. All over the world, we
                        see the bitter legacy of old conflicts and enmities. It is a source of many
                        of our most persistent challenges. I see it every day as I work with
                        governments on very intractable conflicts that are difficult to even imagine
                        resolving because of the accumulated history of mistrust, of violence that
                        has joined peoples together over time. But how remarkable it is that the
                        American and Vietnamese people have decided to leave behind a history they
                        could not change and embrace a future that we can shape together.</p>
                    <p>I was recently in Hanoi. I will be returning to Hanoi at the end of next
                        month. My first visit when I went with my husband when he was President, 10
                        years ago, was extraordinarily moving. We met our counterparts at that time
                        in the Government of Vietnam. We walked the streets of the cities. There are
                        many stores in Hanoi with our picture where we helped the economy
                        dramatically. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>But the most moving experience was our visit to a site where Vietnamese and
                        American archeologists, along with American and Vietnamese soldiers, were
                        searching together for the remains of a missing United States pilot who had
                        crashed 33 years before, Lieutenant Colonel Lawrence Evert. Bill and I stood
                        there watching this work with Lieutenant Colonel Evert’s children, now grown
                        beside us. We watched the workers carefully sift through the mud. Knee deep,
                        they painstakingly excavated the fragments of Colonel Evert’s F-105 fighter
                        plane and the tatters of his uniform. It was a sacred site and both sides
                        were joined in that work. The Vietnamese Government had sent engineers to
                        help, villagers had come forward with artifacts and information, and
                        eventually the Everts were able to take their father home.</p>
                    <p>On this last trip to Hanoi, I stood on the tarmac of the airport while a
                        military process that accompanies the return of the remains of every
                        American lost in Vietnam occurred, and I again was struck by the solemnity
                        and the sacredness of the work. Thanks to the unprecedented cooperation
                        between our governments and our peoples, as well as the tireless efforts of
                        leaders such as Senator John McCain, Senator John Kerry, and former
                        Ambassador Pete Peterson, many families like the Everts in both countries
                        have been able to find some measure of peace.</p>
                    <p>The image of that dig 10 years ago has stayed with me. Americans and
                        Vietnamese covered in mud, searching together for traces of a shared and
                        painful past, not because they sought to relive it nor to open old wounds,
                        but because together we recognized we have to face our past if we’re going
                        to make peace with it.</p>
                    <p>And that is what history, your work, this conference, and the many volumes
                        that have been published, is all about. Historians are excavating, sifting,
                        and straining, helping us know our history more fully so that we can put the
                        past behind us and move forward together.</p>
                    <p>The progress between Vietnam and the United States has been breathtaking.
                        When I was in Hanoi to help commemorate the 15th anniversary of the
                        normalization of relations, I addressed a large group of American and
                        Vietnamese businesses that are working together. Our trade agreement has
                        created jobs and spurred growth on both sides of the Pacific. Our friendship
                        has become an anchor of security and stability in the region. An entire
                        generation of young people has grown up knowing only peace between Vietnam
                        and America, and the relationships that they are forming through educational
                        and cultural exchanges, through new businesses and social networks are
                        drawing us even closer together.</p>
                    <p>Vietnam is home to an ancient and proud civilization. This year, Hanoi will
                        celebrate its 1,000th birthday. But it is also a dynamic and growing nation
                        with a young and vibrant population. I met so many young people working at
                        the conference center, young Vietnamese, who came up and asked me if there
                        could be more educational exchanges, more scholarships, more cooperation
                        between the young people of both our countries. I think there is an enormous
                        amount that still lies ahead of what we can do together as we deepen and
                        broaden our relationship. And I am confident that the next 15 years will
                        bring the United States and Vietnam closer together.</p>
                    <p>I also hope that our commitment to a shared future, despite our shared
                        history, can serve as an inspiration and even a model to others, because
                        there are so many countries who are being held back because they cannot
                        overcome their past, who refuse to search for common ground because the
                        ground behind them is littered with the bodies and the blood of previous
                        generations. In today’s world, it is more imperative than ever that we seek
                        to end conflict and to look for ways that we can connect based on our common
                        humanity. We will not agree on everything. We will have different political
                        systems. But we have to look for a way to find that common ground and to
                        work toward common aspirations that fulfill the potential for peace,
                        progress, and prosperity.</p>
                    <p>So I thank you for being here for this conference. I am looking forward to
                        hearing reports of the day’s events. I have looked at the program. It is
                        quite international. We have experts not just from Vietnam and the United
                        States, but from universities around the world. And we appreciate greatly
                        the efforts that everyone has made led by our historians here in the State
                        Department, not only to put on this conference, but to help us come to terms
                        with our own history.</p>
                    <p>Thank you all very much. (Applause.)</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">SECRETARY KISSINGER:</hi> Thank you very much. I must
                        point out that I hold one record that will be hard to exceed, that during
                        the period that I was both Secretary of State and Security Advisor,
                        relations between the State Department and the White House were at an
                        unprecedented high. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>Now, I have about 20 minutes to make observations and then answer questions.
                        And when I heard that somebody picked up my book in 1958 that was turned
                        down by eight commercial publishers and four university presses, had sold
                        1400 copies, it became clear to me that most people in this room weren’t
                        born when this book was read. And Dick Holbrooke and I were talking last
                        night about the likely composition of this audience, and there are a few
                        here who went through it all as a contemporary experience, and they will
                        have experience, passions, and upheavals that were unique and that are
                        impossible to recreate.</p>
                    <p>Then there’s another group that learned of this from their faculties about
                        most of whom were in the protest movement during the actual period and they
                        have their view. And then there is a new generation for whom this is very
                        far in the past. And it occurred to me last night as I was thinking about
                        it, for my aged generation in 1940 the fall of France was a shattering
                        experience, especially for people who had lived in Nazi Germany.</p>
                    <p>But actually the Vietnam War is back from our period as far as 1900 was in
                        1940. For me, 1900 was an event with only the slightest relationship to any
                        of my experiences. So what I thought I might do is to give you some
                        description of how I got involved in this, what it meant to my generation,
                        and then you ask me questions on any specific subject that you have on your
                        mind.</p>
                    <p>First, you have to understand a personal thing. I had a very peculiar
                        position as Security Advisor. It could never happen again today. I had never
                        met Richard Nixon when he appointed me. And I had spent 12 years of my life
                        trying to keep him from becoming President. (Laughter.) I was the principal
                        foreign policy advisor of Nelson Rockefeller. So when I read some of these
                        books of how carefully I plotted my ascent to that office, I think it is
                        important to keep – to remember that I was a close friend of Nelson
                        Rockefeller and, actually, I knew Hubert Humphrey a lot better. Well, I
                        didn’t know Nixon at all.</p>
                    <p>So it was an intellectual enterprise, a national enterprise how to deal with
                        this issue. Also, as most of you know, I had worked for one year as a
                        consultant in the Kennedy White House during the Berlin crisis, not on
                        Vietnam issues but on Berlin issues. The result of that was that the key
                        people of the previous administration were people I had known. They were my
                        friends. I respected them. I had huge admiration for Dean Rusk’s patriotism
                        and his conduct in office. I had seen the anguish of people dealing with
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>So to me, the debates that followed were personally especially painful and
                        never for me had the character of a civil war that they later acquired. To
                        me, I knew why the generation that preceded me had entered the Vietnam War.
                        I agreed with some of their views; I disagreed with others. But I did not
                        think they were a moral issue dividing us and, indeed, I suffered from
                        delusion when I entered the government that I could make a contribution to
                        bringing the various views together.</p>
                    <p>To me, the tragedy of the Vietnam War was not that there were disagreements.
                        That was inevitable given the complexity of the subject. But that the faith
                        of Americans in each other became destroyed in the process. It was America’s
                        first experience with limits in foreign policy, and it was something painful
                        to accept.</p>
                    <p>So what would be a natural critique of decisions that were arguable at
                        various stages became transmuted into a moral issue, first about the moral
                        adequacy of American foreign policy altogether, and then into the moral
                        adequacy of America in conducting any kind of traditional foreign policy.
                        That was the tragedy.</p>
                    <p>I’m absolutely unreconstructed on that subject. I believe that most of what
                        went wrong in Vietnam we did to ourselves. And while I support the current
                        policies of the Administration with respect to Vietnam, while I’m delighted
                        to see Vietnamese representatives there, I thought then as I do now. I would
                        have preferred another outcome, at least another outcome that was not so
                        intimately related to the way we tore ourself apart. And you have to
                        understand that this was my view then and it is my view now.</p>
                    <p>I was – I have recently read a book that was published in Hanoi about my
                        negotiations with Le Duc Tho, which is, I would say, 98 percent accurate.
                        And where it is inaccurate it is not essential to the theme and maybe
                        accurate even in those two points and simply a question of perspective. And
                        they brought home – it brought home again one fundamental difference:
                        America wanted compromise; Hanoi wanted victory.</p>
                    <p>One of, to me, interesting things if the ambassador will forgive me, is in my
                        day-to-day dealing with Le Duc Tho, he was at the edge of obnoxiousness. I
                        mean he operated on us like a surgeon with a scalpel with enormous skill,
                        always courteous, but he occasionally would be told from Hanoi, according to
                        that book, to remember that there could be no negotiations until there had
                        been a military change. And then his purpose was to get us to that point. I
                        say that with great respect for him. It is very understandable. The
                        Vietnamese had fought for 50 years not to make a compromise but to unify
                        their country. The objective goal of American policy was to preserve a
                        viable South Vietnam that would be given a chance to develop its own
                        identity, and those were, in fact, daily concern objectives. That was a fact
                        of life.</p>
                    <p>In all the discussions that took place about what we did or didn’t do in
                        negotiations, what more we could have offered or what less we should have
                        put forward, there was really only one issue that was not soluble, and that
                        issue was: Should South Vietnam have its own political identity, be
                        permitted to develop its own institutions, or should it be presumed from the
                        beginning that unification was the objective. All the various proposals that
                        were hotly debated about – ceasefire and the various combinations – they
                        were, in one way or another, very quickly more or less settled. What was not
                        settled is whether the existing government in South Vietnam could survive,
                        would be permitted to survive. When that was agreed, we settled very
                        quickly. Some people in this room may think too quickly. But I’ll be glad to
                        answer questions on that and related topics. But that is the issue that
                        needs to be understood.</p>
                    <p>Now once, when the Nixon Administration came into office, what was the
                        situation? The war had gone on depending on how you count if you count back
                        to the Truman period or to the Kennedy period or to the period when we sent
                        combat troops. So you can have different starting points anywhere from four
                        to fifteen years.</p>
                    <p>There were, at that point, 550,000 – or 536,000 to be precise – American
                        troops in Vietnam. In ‘68, in the second half of ‘68, the casualties ran at
                        about 400 a week. And the Tet Offensive had taken place in early ‘68. By
                        most today considered an American military victory, but a psychological
                        defeat and at that time, not considered a military victory either, but to
                        prove that the war was unwinnable. No negotiation – the negotiations had
                        just started. The formal position of the United States was mutual withdrawal
                        in which ours would begin after that of the North Vietnamese. And the
                        outgoing administration left papers written by Harriman and Vance, saying
                        that after a settlement, 260,000 American troops would be needed to remain
                        in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>So we made – I’ll just explain what the basic strategy was; what was
                        attempted to be done. There were two schools of thought, of which really
                        only one received serious consideration. My personal view was that we should
                        make a very sweeping comprehensive peace offer. And if that was rejected,
                        step up military action and then see where we were. It went – this proposal
                        went this far as asking former Secretary Vance to go to Moscow to negotiate
                        there with the Vietnamese. And we gave the Soviets a proposal that went far
                        beyond anything that had been proposed at the time. That was never answered.
                        The Russians never answered; the Vietnamese never answered.</p>
                    <p>We then sort of dilatorily studied enhanced military action, which is the
                        subject of many investigative journalists. But the decision that was finally
                        made was that we would withdraw gradually, negotiate concurrently, and
                        hopefully reach a point at which the – Hanoi would agree to our basic
                        political proposal. I won’t go through all the steps. And over a period of
                        four years we substantially achieved that objective.</p>
                    <p>One of my associates was Winston Lord. And when we – during the incursions of
                        Cambodia, he wanted to resign. And I said to him, “Well, you can resign and
                        walk around with a placard outside this building, or you can help me end
                        this. And you have to ask yourself what you will feel better about 20 years
                        from now.” And he stayed. And sometimes people ask me what was my most
                        moving moment in government, and I can tell you my most moving moment was
                        when Le Duc Tho in October 1972, in effect, accepted the proposals that we
                        had made in January of that year, about the structure of that government. In
                        fact, he even read a statement saying, “This is, after all, what you’ve
                        proposed.” And when he was finished, I shook hands with Winston and said,
                        “Well, we’ve done it.” But it turned out we hadn’t done it for many reasons.
                        Maybe it was objectively never possible, which I deny. But anyway,
                        reasonable people can make this argument.</p>
                    <p>But fundamentally, when it was the combination of Watergate and our domestic
                        divisions – the combination of Watergate and domestic divisions which cut
                        aid to Vietnam by two-thirds, while oil prices were rising – that prohibited
                        any military assistance to Vietnam, something we have not asked any ally to
                        do at any point. So that is my perception of what happened.</p>
                    <p>Of course, there were many stages in that process. It was – there were – I
                        will just mention one. The Chinese and we had made an agreement on Cambodia
                        that was supposed to go into effect as soon as Sihanouk came back from a
                        trip. And the one part of it was the end of American bombing and in
                        Cambodia, which was maintained because the Khmer Rouge did not observe the
                        ceasefire.</p>
                    <p>So it was Senator Magnuson who was visiting China, and he had a meeting with
                        Zhou Enlai, and Zhou Enlai was complaining about the American bombing in
                        Cambodia which was his part of the deal. And Magnuson said, “Don’t worry
                        about it. The Congress has just stopped it.” Whereupon, Zhou Enlai flew into
                        a rage and started pounding the table because he – that it turned out, that
                        an agreement he had made did not make him look very effective. But this is
                        one of those episodes. The fundamental point I want to make is this: We
                        cannot afford a divided country and go to war. We owe it to ourselves to
                        have confidence, at least, in the good faiths of our government. We cannot
                        turn these issues into a moral contest between people who claim a monopoly
                        of goodwill and describe by absolute, not just incorrect assessments, but
                        amoral attitudes.</p>
                    <p>We made – there are a number of lessons we have to learn. When we consider
                        going to war, we need a global strategic analysis that explains to us what
                        the significance of this is. The purpose of a war is some definition of
                        victory; stalemate is not a strategy, and victory needs to be defined as an
                        outcome that is achievable in a period sustainable by American public
                        opinion.</p>
                    <p>I do not like the word “exit strategy”. We shouldn’t be in if all we want is
                        an exit. It has to be presented to the President as a sustainable diplomatic
                        framework. Diplomacy and strategy must be treated as a whole, not as
                        successive phases of policy. And above all, the Administration, as well as
                        the critics, should conduct their debates with the restraint imposed by the
                        knowledge that the unity of this country has been and will remain the hope
                        of the world.</p>
                    <p>And I want to say that – how happy I am that Dick Holbrooke is following me,
                        because we shared some of these experiences not always from identical points
                        of view, but always with great mutual respect. We met in Hanoi in Saigon
                        when we were both promising young men, he more than I. (Laughter.) And when
                        I was that age, I used to think that people of my current age were put into
                        this world as old people – (laughter) – that they had always been that
                        way.</p>
                    <p>So thank you for letting me come here. It’s been an extraordinary, moving
                        experience in my life. And I want to express my respect to the Vietnamese
                        who are here and my delight that relations between our two countries are as
                        strong as they appear. But that does not alter my sadness at the way the
                        Vietnam War was permitted to evolve.</p>
                    <p>Thank you very much, and I’ll take questions. (Applause.)</p>

                        Kissinger has opened up in a wonderful way an invitation for a discussion.
                        Might I ask that the questions be questions rather than statements, that way
                        we will be able to take full advantage of Dr. Kissinger’s presence here to
                        answer a number of questions between now and close to 11 o’clock.</p>
                    <p>We have two gentlemen from the Historian’s Office who are going to be holding
                        the microphones working from both sides. Raise your hand if you would like
                        to ask a question, and upon payment of $50, they’ll be glad to come to –
                        (laughter) – let you ask them. Thank you very much.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Dr. Kissinger, I’d like to ask you about
                        what’s known in the historian’s field as the decent interval strategy,
                        namely the argument that the Administration’s policy was premised on the
                        idea that a withdrawal of the United States should be accomplished and that
                        there should be a decent interval between then and the prospect of a
                        communist takeover in the south, and I know you know some of the materials
                        on this. I wondered if you would give your perspective as to whether you
                        thought South Vietnam could sustain in existence as a viable state.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">SECRETARY KISSINGER:</hi> First of all, as historians,
                        what you should do when you see statements is to ask yourself about the
                        context in which they were made. And you will find that all the statements
                        that are sort of twisted into decent interval statements were made to the
                        other side, almost all of them. And what they were attempting to say was we
                        are willing to have a political contest, and we are willing to abide by the
                        outcome of that political contest. But that didn’t mean that we were
                        resigned to the outcome of that political contest. We were going to support
                        our allies in that political contest.</p>
                    <p>But you have this debate in America where people who, in effect, say, “You
                        have to get out now. You were immoral ever to get in.” But then you’re
                        accused of selling out when you say you are leaving, that you are fighting
                        for the possibility of committing the people of South Vietnam an
                        opportunity.</p>
                    <p>Now what did we think would happen? We knew it was a precarious agreement. We
                        knew that the North Vietnamese had not fought for 50 years in order simply
                        to become a North Vietnamese state, so we thought that the contest would
                        continue. We thought – might be wrong there – that the South Vietnamese had
                        proved in 1972 that when there was an all-out North Vietnamese offensive,
                        that they could sustain a significant shock and survive politically and even
                        militarily.</p>
                    <p>We thought – and I’m telling you what we thought on that. We thought that the
                        South Vietnamese could – if you look, the structure of the agreement was
                        that the North Vietnamese could maintain the forces they had, but they could
                        not reinforce them and they could not add to them. We thought the South
                        Vietnamese could handle it. We thought – we also expected that if there were
                        an all-out attack, we would come to the assistance of the South Vietnamese,
                        at least with air force and naval power. That was prohibited by a
                        congressional action six months later. And when you make an agreement, which
                        you can neither support with economic assistance nor with military force,
                        you have, in effect, surrendered.</p>
                    <p>So yes, we could not commit ourselves for all eternity to maintain a
                        government against all conceivable contingencies. So in that sense, the
                        decent interval phrase has a meaning. But when you see what we did and how
                        we acted and how important I thought it was that even in the last months we
                        did not look as if we were simply throwing a frenzied people to their fate.
                        You know what our preference was. We had to act, however, within what was
                        possible. But this was a general outline of what we thought.</p>
                    <p>Yes.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> You referenced in your remarks a couple of
                        times the question of public opinion and the importance of the American
                        public at large. I would like to ask you about the role of the media as
                        informers and perhaps shapers of public opinion. What influence, if any, did
                        contemporary news media have on the strategy and diplomacy implemented in
                        Vietnam and possibly its outcome? Thank you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">SECRETARY KISSINGER:</hi> I make a distinction between
                        public opinion and the media. I think public opinion, insofar as one could
                        determine that, was always basically supportive of the general direction of
                        the policy. The media became extremely hostile and increasingly hostile and
                        bought into the proposition that an evil government in both the Johnson
                        Administration and then in the Nixon Administration was lying, tricking
                        because it had some commitment to warlike policies. And that made it
                        extremely difficult to conduct a policy because the Beltway consensus shaped
                        – I mean, I was reviewing, in connection with another matter, some of the
                        material that I know is also in these volumes of the discussions that went
                        on within our government when it was perfectly obvious that the North
                        Vietnamese were planning an all-out offensive in the spring of ’72 and all
                        the signs were there. But we cut back our action because we did not want to
                        be accused of having triggered what we knew was coming anyway. So that was
                        one of the battles.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, it cannot be said that the Nixon Administration will go
                        down in history for its skill in handling the media, and there was a
                        confrontational aspect to the Nixon presidency that contributed to this
                        atmosphere. And I’m not here to blame anyone or any group. I’m here to
                        describe a situation that existed and that everybody has an obligation to
                        prevent from recurring. But the role of the media, on the whole, was, of
                        course, destructive.</p>
                    <p>But there are always exceptions. There was – I remember in <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Washington Post</hi>, there was a writer called Chalmers Roberts. I
                        don’t know whether any of you remember him. And he had really studied the
                        Vietnam issue. And he would call me up sometimes – not to get a great story,
                        but to call my attention to something that had been said that might be
                        significant. So I would not apply what I have said to every single
                        journalist that we dealt with. But the media, sort of on their own, would
                        not face the complexities that people – that one was facing and took an
                        (inaudible) attitude to the Nixon Administration. That is Dean Rusk’s son
                        and grandson here. People like Dean Rusk, McNamara, and Johnson, whom I know
                        – they were desperate about ending the war.</p>
                    <p>And so all of this debate about their intentions and their war-like attitude
                        – they may not have had the right analogies, but fundamentally, once the war
                        started, I think now if my Vietnamese friends here will forgive me, it could
                        end only in victory or defeat. And victory was preserving some political
                        structure itself, be it not – there was no negotiating position you could
                        take that would deprive the North Vietnamese of something they had fought
                        for for 50 years. And the media attempt to turn this into a detective story
                        in which the North Vietnamese threw out great clues and we had to guess at
                        the answer – and if we missed the answer, their feelings would be so hurt,
                        that just isn’t how they act.</p>
                    <p>They didn’t survive a thousand years as neighbors of China by being very
                        malleable. And so – well, take another question. Yes, sir.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">SECRETARY KISSINGER:</hi>Well, let me say this. I put
                        forward this argument where, first of all, Nixon agreed to a comprehensive
                        offer and we made it. Escalation was considered and rejected, so my own
                        position, it’s in small print in the appendix to <hi rend="italic">White
                            House Years</hi> where I expressed reservations about the Vietnamization
                        strategy and other things. But I did not follow those memos into the Oval
                        Office. So I didn’t fight for it because I thought the opposition and the
                        administration would be too great, and Nixon didn’t act on it. And that
                        doesn’t mean – I just put it forward for intellectual completeness. I think
                        the course we adopted was probably the only possible course.</p>

                        Harvard University. In your 1973 Senate confirmation hearings, you said that
                        the U.S. wasn’t bombing Cambodians, just North Vietnamese and Cambodia. But
                        in your 2003 book <hi rend="italic">Ending the Vietnam War</hi>, you cite a
                        figure from the Department of Defense of 50,000 Cambodian civilian
                        casualties. I wanted to know how you would amend your testimony today.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">SECRETARY KISSINGER:</hi> Why should I amend my testimony?
                        (Laughter.) Because what?</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> (Off-mike.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">SECRETARY KISSINGER:</hi> Oh, come on. It’s – we weren’t
                        running around the country bombing Cambodians. We were fighting – we – oh,
                        you – I think – why did we try to prevent the Khmer Rouge from taking over
                        Cambodia? I don’t quite understand the question except that I didn’t tell
                        the truth.</p>
                    <p>Well, when you talk about bombing of Cambodia, there’s three different
                        bombing operations in Cambodia. There’s the so-called secret bombing that
                        was so secret that there were seven newspaper articles in The Washington
                        Post and The New York Times in May and June and – about which 24 senior
                        members of Congress were briefed. That was in essentially unpopulated areas,
                        and I don’t believe it had any significant casualties. It might have been
                        consequences in moving the – there’s a debate whether it moved the
                        Vietnamese deeper into Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>The second was the combat operations that resulted from the incursions of
                        American and Vietnamese troops into Cambodia. And I would assume the
                        casualties there were about what they were in similar operations in Vietnam.
                        And I want to point out that no pictures ever of genocidal bombing were
                        published, so I’m assuming that didn’t take place.</p>
                    <p>And then there was a third period that was between February of ‘73 and June
                        ‘73 in which we tried to stop the Khmer Rouge from taking over Cambodia and
                        we – under the misapprehension that the Khmer Rouge were a tool of Hanoi and
                        in which we wanted to use our bombing to negotiate a coalition government
                        outcome in Cambodia. The rules of engagement for that bombing can be found
                        in the appendix of my book on ending the Vietnam War and also in the
                        appendix of Volume III of my memoirs. And the rules of engagement were that
                        they could not bomb within a mile of occupied – of civilian settlements and
                        that bombing had to be approved first by the Government of Cambodia and
                        above all by our Ambassador on the recommendation on the local
                        commander.</p>
                    <p>Were mistakes made? In that study from which I quoted the rules of
                        engagement, they mentioned two mistakes, two cases where civilians were
                        within this, but I don’t (inaudible) for the brief for it. But those were
                        the three different operations. And of course, they were not aimed at
                        Cambodians as such, they were considered an aspect of how to end the Vietnam
                        War.</p>
                    <p>Yes, sir.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> (In Vietnamese.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">INTERPRETER:</hi>Okay, hopefully I’ll get these questions
                        right. The first one he – the first question is regarding your comment about
                        that peace was at hand. And he was wondering why – if peace was at hand,
                        what was the rationale behind the Christmas bombings? How do you reconcile
                        the two?</p>
                    <p>The second question is about your comments about Le Duc Tho and, in
                        particular – I didn’t catch the – oh, he wants to know how did Le Duc Tho
                        make you an old man which is what you said to them at the beginning.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">SECRETARY KISSINGER:</hi> About what?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> How was it that he made you an old man? How
                        was it that they – that Le Duc Tho aged you? This was a comment that you had
                        said to them in the beginning.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">SECRETARY KISSINGER:</hi> Oh, I said to the general when I
                        came in that I’m really much younger than I look, -- (laughter) – that Le
                        Duc Tho aged me. First, let me say something about “peace is at hand” and
                        then I’ll say something about Le Duc Tho.</p>
                    <p>First, the “peace is at hand.” When I read books about this, it makes it
                        sound as if I was hiding behind a curtain, came out, said, “Peace is at
                        hand,” and ducked right back behind that curtain – (laughter) – so that
                        Richard Nixon could win an election where he was already leading by 20
                        points and where his nightmare was that I’d screw it up by getting the
                        conservatives riled up.</p>
                    <p>Well, anybody who wants to know about the “peace is at hand” statement should
                        read the press conference. It’s a 10 page single-spaced document in which I
                        go through every provision of the agreement and explain what was in the
                        agreement. And with all due respect, the hotshot journalists there could
                        have gone through this and pointed out what was sensible, what wasn’t
                        sensible, and they could have said it isn’t. So secondly, I didn’t know I
                        was – it was a minor point – I thought this was a background briefing. I
                        didn’t know that it was live. Third, what is it I was trying to do? What was
                        the purpose of the exercise?</p>
                    <p>We had made – come to an understanding with the North Vietnamese in Paris. It
                        became apparent in Saigon that we could not implement it. We had always had
                        the position that Saigon would have to agree. We had made a mistake in our
                        judgment. We thought that Thieu would be so happy with the fact that he was
                        preserved, that his government was preserved, that he would not haggle about
                        all the subsidiary clauses. On the other hand, he had to live there. And so
                        we decided not to impose it on him prior to an election. So we had to
                        convince – first we had to convince Hanoi that we meant to stay within the
                        framework of the agreement and this is why we affirmed most of the key
                        provisions.</p>
                    <p>We had to convince Saigon that we meant to go through. And I think at the end
                        of the press conference I said, “We will not complete this agreement until
                        it is ready, until it meets its conditions, but we will not stop once it is
                        ready,” something like that. So that was the purpose of “peace is at hand.”
                        We faced a very complex situation. We wanted Hanoi to continue. We wanted
                        Saigon to be convinced that we meant it. And we invited Hanoi to agree to
                        some modifications.</p>
                    <p>Now, Le Duc Tho – this is like asking a patient what he thinks of his
                        surgeon. I had high regard for Le Duc Tho. Here he was, the representative
                        of a small country, with no huge international experience, facing the
                        representative of the super power, always maintaining his calm, his
                        discipline, pursuing his strategy. I knew exactly what he was doing, which
                        was to exhaust us. And one of the typical moments was he had an opening
                        statement which included a dramatic account of Vietnamese history which took
                        about 40 minutes. And it was the same each time, so I knew it by heart.
                        (Laughter.) And one of the phrases in his words, if you make a big effort,
                        we will make a big effort. So one day he said, “If you make a big effort,
                        we’ll make an effort.” So just to break the monotony, I said, “Mr. Special
                        Advisor, I noticed that you dropped an adjective in what you have just
                        said.” And he said, “I’m so glad you noticed it.” He said, “Because
                        yesterday we made a big effort and you only made an effort.” (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>So he was skillful. He had his objective. In my judgment, his objective was
                        there was no intention of Vietnam -- of Hanoi ever to settle unless we
                        either overthrew the Saigon government, which was their basic term or they
                        had had an offensive. We were not prepared to overthrow the Saigon
                        government. So they had their offensive. And when the offensive didn’t
                        succeed, they went back to the negotiations. And one satisfaction I got out
                        of this book that was published in Hanoi was that even then Le Duc Tho was
                        given three options on which to settle, and he finally settled on the most
                        forthcoming option from our point of view. So -- but it took three months he
                        went back.</p>
                    <p>So it’s an interesting study of -- but to sum it up, I had high regard for
                        him as a skillful, determined strategist who always conducted himself with
                        great politeness and great skill. I’d look a lot better if I’d never met
                        him. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR BRYNN:</hi> Let me intervene. We have almost 11
                        o’clock. Mr. Rusk, if you want to make one quick question.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Yes, sir. Dr. Kissinger, my name is Rich
                        Rusk. I’m Dean Rusk’s number two son. Thanks so much for the words of
                        respect for my father. I have the same great respect for all your years of
                        public service, everything you did in office, everything you tried to do.
                        I’m not one to take up for the critics of Vietnam policy. As a matter of
                        fact, I hated with a visceral passion when all this was playing out, many of
                        those who were critical of this war.</p>
                    <p>But Dr. Kissinger, when you say that most of what went wrong in Vietnam were
                        just -- most of what went wrong we did to ourselves, it seems to me most of
                        what went wrong was the decisions made by three administrations, a small
                        handful of advisors of which my father was one. And it’s these three
                        administrations that sent American troops, American soldiers against a man
                        and against a movement that had driven the Japanese out of Indo-China in
                        World War II, that drove the French out in the aftermath of that, a man who
                        had captured the spirit of Vietnamese nationalism. My father never denied
                        his share of the responsibilities for those decisions. I’m not suggesting
                        that you did either. Obviously, he had misapplied, I think, some of the
                        lessons that he had learned from World War II.</p>
                    <p>My question to you -- I realize you need a question not a statement. My
                        question to you is where have I gone wrong in my thinking, conversely, even
                        at this late date? Or the other question is where have you gone wrong in
                        yours?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">SECRETARY KISSINGER:</hi>We did it to ourselves, that of
                        course includes also judgments --obviously judgments that were made. There
                        were a number of mistakes, judgments about the relations between Soviet and
                        Chinese strategy, between Chinese and North Vietnamese strategy that were
                        made that involved us in the war in the first place. My point is these were
                        not -- they were judgments that grew out of the experience of the previous
                        period with containment in Europe. And they were understandable judgments
                        that were made -- were wrong in some respects. They did not justify the
                        bitterness and the viciousness of the ensuing debate, in my opinion.</p>
                    <p>We did not put troops in. We took the troops out. When we came in, there were
                        540,000 troops. We withdrew at the rate of 150,000 a year. And the problem
                        of extrication, which I’m sure our Vietnamese friends will understand, we
                        had 800,000 North Vietnamese troops in the country. We had a million South
                        Vietnamese troops that could turn hostile if they felt we were abandoning
                        them. And we had 540,000 Americans in these circumstances. So that was a
                        tricky -- well, of course, mistakes were made in this process. I’m not here
                        to claim that the -- I’m not here as a spokesman of the Nixon
                        Administration. I’m here as somebody who has spent his life on American
                        foreign policy and who, partly from personal history, believes that this
                        country is a crucial component for peace in the world. And to see this
                        process -- because once it got started, you could not be reverse like your
                        father used to say. He said, “This isn’t like turning off a television
                        program.”</p>
                    <p>So I found somewhere in Johnson’s statements where he said, “I can’t win and
                        I can’t get out.” That was the dilemma that America faced towards every
                        single decision that I’d -- of course not. Is there are any seminal mistake
                        that was made that I know in the period in which I served, we had no choice
                        about getting out right away. That was not a conceivable option. It was
                        never proposed by even the tough element in the Democratic Party. So once we
                        decided to withdraw gradually, could it have been speeded up? I don’t know.
                        I -- the only way to speed it up was to overthrow the government. That we
                        weren’t willing to do. Was that a mistake? I don’t think so.</p>
                    <p>And I have also more sympathy for the people who made the original decisions
                        who were applying a model that didn’t fit Southeast Asia and who didn’t
                        understand that the Soviet Union and China and Vietnam were different
                        entities and that a victorious Vietnam was less likely to be an enemy of
                        ours than an enemy of a lot of other countries. So, of course, mistakes will
                        always be made in government. But the question for our society is whether we
                        can have a serious debate about them or whether we have to turn it into a
                        civil war. That seems, to me, the key point that I was trying to make.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR BRYNN:</hi> Let me intervene. Let me thank Dr.
                        Kissinger for an elegant and incisive presentation and what a standard he

                        <hi rend="strong">MODERATOR:</hi> I would like now to turn to Ambassador
                        Richard C. Holbrooke. The Vietnam War was the focus of Ambassador
                        Holbrooke’s earliest years in public service. He joined the Foreign Service
                        in 1962 and served in Vietnam from 1963 to 1966. He worked Vietnam issues at
                        the Johnson White House from 1966 to 1968 and was a member of the American
                        delegation to the Vietnam peace talks in Paris in 1968 and 1969. While
                        serving in Vietnam, Ambassador Holbrooke drafted a prescient memorandum on
                        challenges and problems associated with pacification and counterinsurgency.
                        This memorandum can be found in the 1966 Vietnam Volume of the Foreign
                        Relations of the United States. From 1977 to 1981, Ambassador Holbrooke
                        served as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
                        During the Clinton Administration, he held a series of high offices –
                        Ambassador to Germany, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs,
                        and as a member of President Clinton’s cabinet in his capacity as Ambassador
                        to the United Nations. He was the chief architect of the 1995 Dayton Peace
                        Accord.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Holbrooke has made his mark outside government as well as managing
                        editor of Foreign Policy from 1972 to 1977, as vice chairman of Credit
                        Suisse First Boston, and as managing director of Lehman Brothers. His
                        bestselling book, To End a War, published in 1999, and his role as co-author
                        with Clark Clifford in Counsel to the President, published in 1992, are
                        well-known to everyone in this audience. I am honored to invite Ambassador
                        Holbrooke to address us today. (Applause.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:</hi>Thank you very much for inviting
                        me here and thank you, Henry, for a remarkable and very valuable
                        presentation this morning. First, I want to congratulate the Office of the
                        Historian. The FRUS series on American foreign policy has been an absolutely
                        indispensable document center for several generations. These volumes contain
                        richly textured memos, documents, memcons, tapes, that leap off the page and
                        bring to life forgotten events with contemporary relevance.</p>
                    <p>We should note, however, that in all likelihood, the volumes being released
                        now will never be matched again, because after Watergate, the detailed
                        recordkeeping of the past is not – was not possible anymore. And after the
                        modern technologies which Hillary referred to, with emails and video
                        teleconferences, documentation just isn’t what it used to be. Reading these
                        volumes, dipping into them, is remarkable. Yesterday I found Henry Kissinger
                        and Richard Nixon discussing the North Vietnamese offensive, at which point
                        they diverged into a detailed discussion of the Battle of the Nations in
                        Leipzig in 1813 and whether Napoleon might have won or not. Nixon’s view was
                        they could have; Henry’s view was it was inevitable Napoleon would lose. But
                        that is the kind of texture you’re not going to find 30 years from now when
                        FRUS is released. There’s also a very detailed discussion of an obscure
                        event in World War I at another point. So I congratulate the Historian and
                        their office for this timely contribution and I’m honored to be part of the
                        event. I’m even more honored to see that I’m now old enough to have
                        something I wrote declassified. (Laughter.) In fact, it was declassified
                        some time ago, but I wasn’t aware of it till recently. So I read through
                        this memo, reread the memo that was just mentioned, and my first reaction
                        was a very deep concern because I clearly wrote better then than I write
                        now. And of course, I was very young. I was 25 years old, and I can’t
                        believe I was that rude to my superiors. But what I said in it, I leave it
                        to you to determine how that memo holds up.</p>
                    <p>I first met Henry Kissinger in 1965, when he visited Vietnam at the
                        invitation of Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge. He was at the time already a
                        prominent Harvard professor, a great expert on international affairs. I was
                        a 24-year-old junior Foreign Service officer assigned to the Embassy after
                        having served in the lower Mekong Delta, and I had never heard of him. My
                        friends and roommates, John Negroponte and Vladimir Lehovich, were sort of
                        partial control officers for Henry on one or two of his trips, and I’ll
                        leave them to describe the visits. All I knew then watching the way senior
                        officials of the Johnson Administration treated Henry – and the fact that he
                        was shortly to open a back-channel to Hanoi while still a professor at
                        Harvard – meant that this was far more than just another Harvard
                        professor.</p>
                    <p>That first encounter marked the beginning of a friendship that’s now 45 years
                        old and great mutual respect, and I’m very gratified at what you said,
                        Henry, marked by many areas of agreement and collaboration in China when I
                        was Assistant Secretary for East Asia, and Germany when I was Ambassador, at
                        the United Nations in our mutual efforts in regard to these ongoing issues,
                        and a few areas of some disagreement, the most notable of which, of course,
                        is the one that brings us here together today. Those differences have
                        softened over the years, but we do still look at these issues from somewhat
                        different perspectives. I’m not here today, however, to discuss that, but to
                        discuss the books and, first, if you will permit, a brief comment about the
                        narrative of my own experience which was so radically different because I
                        started at the very bottom. It was my first assignment after I entered the
                        Foreign Service.</p>
                    <p>I arrived at Saigon with Vladimir Lehovich on May 26th, 1963. We were greeted
                        by a member of the Rural Affairs Team of AID. His name was Ralph Boynton
                        (ph), if I remember correctly, and he told us to take off our ties and
                        jackets because we were a shirtsleeves office. I stayed on Vietnam until the
                        summer of 1966, serving first in the AID mission in Saigon as a provincial
                        representative in the lower Mekong Delta; as a staff assistant to two
                        ambassadors, Maxwell Taylor and Henry Cabot Lodge; and as part of a special
                        team in the Embassy under Ambassador – Deputy Ambassador William J. Porter,
                        to integrate civilian-military affairs inside the Embassy. In 1966, I was
                        reassigned to the White House to work on Vietnam as part of a special
                        office, not entirely unlike my present job, focused on the civilian side of
                        the war – the other war, as my boss, R.W. Komer, called it.</p>
                    <p>In 1967-68, I had a confusing and overlapping set of assignments. I was
                        assigned simultaneously while still on the White House staff to be part of a
                        small secret task force in the Office of Secretary of Defense Robert S.
                        McNamara. Our assignment was to assemble all the files on Vietnam and write
                        a full history of the war even as it was going on. We weren’t quite sure of
                        the purpose, but our top-secret project, of course, ended up on the front
                        pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post as the Pentagon Papers
                        and provoked one of the epic struggles in American history in the Supreme
                        Court.</p>
                    <p>I then went on to work for Nick Katzenbach, who was Deputy Secretary of State
                        – it was then called Under Secretary, but it was the Deputy Secretary job –
                        on Vietnam. And on March 31st, 1968, I worked on Lyndon B. Johnson’s
                        withdrawal speech with one of his great advisors, Harry McPherson, who is
                        here with us today. I never knew, of course, about the famous ending. I
                        worked on the Vietnam part of the speech with Harry. That speech also opened
                        the door for the first direct talks with Hanoi. And when Averell Harriman
                        and Cyrus Vance were sent to Paris along with our great Foreign Service
                        leader Phil Habib, they asked me to join the team along with John
                        Negroponte. And for the next 15 months, I lived in Paris as part of the team
                        that struggled unsuccessfully to find a path to peace, until on January
                        20th, 1969, we handed off to the new administration, and Henry picked up the
                        story precisely from that point.</p>
                    <p>Finally, in 1969, with Richard Nixon in the White House, I left my seven
                        years of service on Vietnam and went on to other fields, first in Morocco as
                        Peace Corps director, then private life, then back to the government as
                        Jimmy Carter’s Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs, where
                        fate and destiny led me back to Paris in 1977 and 1978 to conduct our effort
                        to normalize relations with Vietnam. That effort also failed, to my deep
                        regret to this day. Had we been able to normalize relations under Jimmy
                        Carter instead of having to wait until the Clinton Administration, I think
                        the path that we’re now on would have taken place earlier.</p>
                    <p>But leaving Vietnam behind did not mean getting it out of one’s system. It
                        stayed with me, even though I didn’t think about it much. Also, I formed
                        friendships of a lifetime, and many of those people are here today. I see in
                        this room my oldest friend from high school, David Rusk, and his son Richie;
                        my first boss in Vietnam Rufus Phillips, whose own book, Why Vietnam
                        Matters, I was honored to write the preface to and which I recommend to any
                        of you who want to drill down more deeply; and although he’s just left a few
                        minutes ago, my other roommate in Saigon, John Negroponte, who also was my
                        deputy in East Asia and my successor at the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>So these relationships go on a very long way. There’s Harry McPherson, my
                        dear friend from the Johnson White House, and many other familiar faces as I
                        look around the room. I see Morley Safer, Marvin Kalb, Bernie Kalb, and so
                        many others of you who I knew in the journalistic corps.</p>
                    <p>Of course, some people who should be here today are not – Stan Karnow, Les
                        Gelb, Frank Wisner, Peter Tarnoff – all dear friends from Saigon days,
                        except Gelb who never set foot in the country but thinks he knew more about
                        it than we do, and he probably did. Stan, Les, Frank, and Peter all should
                        be here today. I talked with all of them this week and I wish they were part
                        of this event.</p>
                    <p>As I leaf through the thousands of pages of documents and cables in these
                        remarkable and important books, memories are triggered, many voices I
                        haven’t heard in years, some still forever, leap off the page and forgotten
                        arguments briefly come back to life. A question still hangs over us, never
                        quite answered: What did it all mean? This was, after all, the greatest
                        domestic debate over foreign policy in American history then and up to
                        today. It divided the government, it divided the city, it divided the
                        nation, it divided individual families.</p>
                    <p>While American soldiers died in Vietnam, Americans of the same age
                        demonstrated and rioted over the war. Some left the country. The divisive
                        anger entered American life. All that was two generations ago. Yet another
                        question persists: Is the Vietnam syndrome over? Consider that the last
                        American soldiers left Saigon 35 years ago and the vast majority of our
                        troops left two years earlier. Think about it. The distance separating us in
                        this room from the helicopters taking the last Americans out of Saigon is
                        greater than the distance between that day in April of 1975 and Pearl
                        Harbor.</p>
                    <p>In more personal terms, the distance from today to my arrival in Vietnam in
                        May of 1963 is greater than from that day to the U.S. entry into World War
                        I. And I thought if I met somebody who remembered World War I when I was in
                        Vietnam, I thought I was talking to somebody from another world. Think about
                        it. If you’re 40 years old today, you were born in 1970, two years after the
                        1968 Tet Offensive. You were five when the war finally ended. You probably
                        know almost nothing about the war itself except that it happened. You see it
                        in bumper posters on TV, flashbacks. Your parents probably rarely mention it
                        except as part of a cultural experience that was called the ‘60s and
                        included Woodstock and other – and the Beatles and all these other things.
                        And yet Vietnam is still used as a metaphor by both the left and the right
                        to justify wholly different situations.</p>
                    <p>So Vietnam is behind us, right? It’s history now to be debated among experts,
                        to be used and abused by polemicists. There have been so many other major
                        events, foreign adventures, and crises since then. And for today’s America,
                        we’re defined – this generation is defined by 9/11, not Vietnam. That is
                        this generation’s event and it carries a wholly different meaning and
                        context for all of us.</p>
                    <p>Yet Vietnam will not go away, and I don’t just mean these documents. The
                        Vietnam War Memorial just a few blocks here, designed by a then-unknown Yale
                        art student named Maya Lin, is the most visited monument in Washington. On
                        every major anniversary of April 30th, 1975, there’s a renewed debate over
                        who lost Vietnam. I can imagine that on the 50th anniversary of that day, in
                        2025, they’ll wheel onto the Today Show the last surviving veterans of the
                        war and the antiwar movement, but then they’re going to start yelling at
                        each other and beating each other over the head with their canes.</p>
                    <p>Of course, it’s more serious than that. Behind the continued debate among
                        experts about whether the war could have been won, a debate that will never
                        be resolved, lies another question of even greater importance: What are the
                        lessons of Vietnam? In fact, as I said earlier, what was that war all about?
                        This too will be debated and I’ll offer – I’ll endeavor to offer a brief
                        personal answer to my own question. As they say, the following does not
                        necessarily represent the views of the U.S. Government.</p>
                    <p>It is still difficult to say in light of those American heroes whose names
                        are engraved just a few blocks from here on that memorial. But I must
                        conclude that our goals in Vietnam did not justify the immense costs of the
                        war. Nor do I believe that success was denied to us because of domestic
                        events and lack of patience on the part of the American public. This is a
                        popular myth that’s gained great currency in the last 30 years.</p>
                    <p>But the fact is that the American people were astonishingly patient and
                        supportive of the war, as was Congress until near the end, for most of the
                        14 years that this war went on despite its immense costs in lives and
                        treasure. And I say 14 years despite recent statements that it was an
                        eight-year war, because this war started, as Richie Rusk mentioned, in 1961
                        for Americans. Small it seemed at the time, but by the time Vladimir and I
                        landed in Saigon, there were already 12,000 Americans on the ground, 45
                        Americans had died by the time we got there. Vlad and I thought, God, that’s
                        a lot of troops, that’s a lot of deaths. When we left, it was 550,000 troops
                        and the number of dead were immensely growing, but it was a 14-year war,
                        from 1961 to 1975.</p>
                    <p>Americans usually support their commander-in-chiefs in wars, and that’s why
                        they did this here. Americans are patriotic and loyal, and they have
                        confidence that the United States Government knows what it’s doing. But in
                        Vietnam, this confidence was ultimately misplaced as we pursued a policy
                        that would have denied Vietnam to the enemy only as long as our ground
                        troops remained, but would not have left the Saigon government strong enough
                        to survive on its own. When we send our young men and women overseas to
                        fight for their country, we must be sure they’re really fighting for our
                        vital national security interests.</p>
                    <p>Those for whom I worked had no doubt of that. Vietnam was part of a global
                        Sino-Soviet movement designed to erode our interests and to spread a
                        doctrine dangerous to our nation’s national security. If we didn’t fight
                        there, we would fight elsewhere close to home. Our leaders in the ‘60s and
                        ‘70s were the men of World War II, Korea, and the Cold War. They had fought
                        in the Pacific. They had fought in Europe. They had fought in Korea. They
                        had seen the Chinese cross the Yalu in Korea, and they feared a similar
                        event in Vietnam. They were insufficiently aware of the effect of the
                        Sino-Soviet split on Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Dean Rusk was typical – I’m speaking now of my first Secretary of State –
                        whose son David, as I mentioned earlier, was my best friend, and who I must
                        stress was the reason – one of the two reasons I joined the Foreign Service,
                        because Dean Rusk had spoken to our high school class and said, “Consider
                        the Foreign Service as a career.” I was then misguided enough to think I
                        wanted to be a journalist, but I overcame that. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>So I look back at Dean Rusk with the greatest personal respect and affection,
                        a seminal figure in my life. He had fought in the China-Burma-India campaign
                        in World War II. He had been Assistant Secretary of State for what was then
                        called the Far East at the time of the Korean War. And while he harbored
                        deep internal doubts about the war, doubts that are reflected in Richie
                        Rusk’s fantastic book in which Richie convinced Dean Rusk to break with a
                        lifetime of tradition – Dean Rusk had said he would never write his memoirs.
                        George Marshall was his model and Marshall had left this building – we’re in
                        the Marshall Center right now – Marshall had left this building, taking only
                        his calendar with him, and Dean Rusk had said he would follow that. But
                        Richie, who had disagreed with his father over Vietnam, had convinced him to
                        – for closure and a very important book was thus produced.</p>
                    <p>And – but while Dean Rusk harbored deep internal doubts about the war, he
                        felt an absolute obligation to support the troops and the President’s
                        policy. He believed deeply in the theory of American invincibility,
                        something I would emphasize to a younger generation, was instilled in every
                        one of us in high school in those days, in those far away days, when we were
                        taught and endlessly reminded that America had never lost a war. All the
                        strength of Dean Rusk’s convictions – convictions we all still would like to
                        be able to hold, of course – were inadequate to the fact that on the ground,
                        as we slid deeper and deeper into the morass, and later as it spread to
                        Cambodia.</p>
                    <p>And so we failed the first test. Our beloved nation sent into battle soldiers
                        without a clear determination of what they could accomplish and they
                        misjudged the stakes. And then we couldn’t get out, as Henry spoke already
                        to that point.</p>
                    <p>We fought bravely under very difficult conditions. But success was not
                        achievable. Those who advocated more escalation or something called,
                        “staying the course,” were advocating something that would have led only to
                        a greater and more costly disaster afterwards. Let me, therefore, be very
                        clear. In my view, this wasn’t about resources and it certainly wasn’t about
                        the patience of the American people or actions by journalists who were often
                        accused of being unpatriotic when they were doing their job.</p>
                    <p>I’m ready to consider the argument, popular in many circles, that more force,
                        more rapidly applied, might have brought a greater readiness by Hanoi to
                        agree to end the war on what might have appeared to be better terms at the
                        time. I also believe that the half measures advocated with such force by
                        Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara were a disaster, regardless of what
                        point you held. But I cannot escape the feeling that in the end, whatever we
                        did, the long-term outcome would have been the same. And ironically, that
                        outcome is precisely the one that Secretary Clinton outlined to you earlier
                        this morning as she talked about the remarkable state today of
                        U.S.-Vietnamese relations.</p>
                    <p>When I returned to Saigon and Hanoi a few years ago as chairman of the Asia
                        Society to host a business development conference, I stood in the square in
                        Saigon in front of the old opera house between the Continental Hotel, the
                        scene of a memorable bombing in Graham Greene’s magnificent novel, The Quiet
                        American, and looked at the new buildings rising around us – buildings with
                        logos familiar to all of us: American Express, Citicorp, Sony – and a
                        subversive ironic thought crept into my mind: If General Westmoreland, who
                        had died before these dramatic changes became apparent, were to be suddenly
                        brought back to that very spot, he’d look around and say, “By God, we won.”
                        (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>So, my friends, we arrive here today in the spirit of reconciliation evoked
                        by Hillary and Henry, with a hope that we have indeed learned something from
                        this long, sad, tragic event.</p>
                    <p>Thank you. (Applause.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MODERATOR:</hi>Ambassador Holbrooke is at the ready to
                        take questions. We want to keep on schedule so that we finish up this part
                        of the presentation by 11 o’clock. Gentlemen, do you have your microphones
                        at the ready?</p>
                    <p>Raise your hand if you have –</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> My name is Harish Mehta and I’m from the
                        University of Toronto. The question is – and this question originally I
                        wanted to kind of direct at Dr. Kissinger, but I didn’t get the chance. And
                        the question really is, we haven’t really focused a great deal on the
                        diplomatic efforts of North Vietnam, and not just the traditional channels
                        of diplomacy which are formal diplomacy, but say the non-traditional
                        channels of diplomacy that is informal or amateur diplomacy. The question
                        really is: What’s your assessment of informal channels of North Vietnamese
                        diplomacy, and that – did the kind of non-traditional North Vietnamese
                        diplomacy have any impact at all in influencing American decision
                        making?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:</hi> This is a very interesting –
                        this is a very interesting question, and it refers to something that now has
                        a name, but didn’t in the 1960s – track-two diplomacy. And there were three
                        or four different versions of this. At the highest level was track two
                        conducted with the official sanction and support of the U.S. Government.
                        Henry Kissinger conducted the single-most important of those channels as a
                        private citizen at Harvard. So he was well prepared for what happened. He
                        had contacts which are well recorded in the Pentagon papers and elsewhere,
                        with people who had direct access to Ho Chi Minh and also through the polls.
                        Those were really important semi – those were sanctioned. Secondly, were
                        serious people who had contacts and did it in a quiet way and kept the U.S.
                        Government informed. And third, were a lot of people who wanted to win the
                        Nobel Peace Prize just by going out and visiting Hanoi and coming back with
                        public statements. That was my first encounter with this particular form of
                        track two.</p>
                    <p>Today, it’s just part of the – it’s part of the ether. There’s so many more
                        NGOs today. One of the biggest changes in American foreign policy is the
                        rise of NGOs, and many of them just set out wherever the problem is to go
                        out and fix it. Sometimes they’ve been very useful, like in Aceh and
                        Indonesia. Other places they’ve been utterly useless and sometimes used by
                        people to pretend flexibility when flexibility is not there.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Ambassador – good morning, Ambassador
                        Holbrooke. My name is (inaudible) Ba (ph) from the Special Guerilla Veterans
                        and Family of USA in St. Paul, and also from Long Tieng Academy. I realize
                        that this conference was going to be talking about the American (inaudible)
                        experience in Southeast Asia, but looking at the program I do not see
                        anything in regard to the covert operation in Laos, and byproduct of that
                        being – I mean, I’m a byproduct of that experience, and I just wondered what
                        is your take. And I would also like to also pose this question to Dr.
                        Kissinger, too, but I didn’t have the opportunity, and I’d like to see what
                        is your perspective in regard to the covert operation inside Laos.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:</hi>Well, the – I – there are two
                        days to go in this conference and I think that level of specifism I’m going
                        to leave to someone else. I was not involved in the covert operations at all
                        in Laos. I was aware of them, of course, because they were not really very
                        covert, and there were tens of thousands of people up there in the Plaine
                        des Jarres. We had secret bases which were not secret, and – but I can’t
                        evaluate it. When you look at Laos today and you compare it to President
                        Kennedy’s then-famous press conference where he came to this building to the
                        Dean Acheson Auditorium, and talked about how Laos is a small, faraway
                        country, but it’s vital to our national security interests, which was in
                        March of 1961, and then you compare it to the realities, you have to ask
                        yourself what kind of mindset. And this was not a partisan thing; everyone
                        agreed with it. President Eisenhower, in his outgoing meeting with President
                        – President-elect Kennedy had told him how critical Laos was, and then you
                        think about it today and you say, “What was this about?” A landlocked
                        country which, in the end, found its own inevitable destiny based on
                        geography.</p>
                    <p>So I would rather not get into the details of this very famous issue. But if
                        any of you are interested in the legacy of it, go see Clint Eastwood’s movie
                        Gran Torino, because the people in that movie and the whole visuals – that’s
                        the Hmong who did all this with us – is this remarkable movie and I strongly
                        recommend it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Hi, I’m Bob McMahon from Ohio State.
                        Ambassador Holbrooke, I wanted to ask you a broader question. So much of the
                        rationale for U.S. involvement and the slowness of American withdrawal from
                        Vietnam revolved around the issue that America’s global credibility was at
                        stake in Vietnam – credibility vis-à-vis allies; they wouldn’t trust us if
                        the United States left an ally to fend for itself, or enemies would be
                        emboldened. You know the arguments. I – just from the perspective of 2010
                        and with all the diplomatic issues that you’ve dealt with since then, how do
                        you think this credibility argument holds up? Does it stand the test of
                        time? Was it exaggerated? Was it reasonable?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:</hi> It’s an immensely difficult
                        question to answer because you’re quite right, and Henry already made it
                        clear in his remarks, that this was a core concern, not only for the Nixon
                        Administration, but for its predecessors and then onward into the Ford
                        Administration. And there’s no doubt that what happens in one area affects
                        the perception of the nation everywhere.</p>
                    <p>What one has to measure is the – is if you can’t achieve your objective, and
                        it’s my view that we could never have achieved our stated objective in
                        Vietnam – which was to keep South Vietnam a separate independent state –
                        without continual presence of ground troops. And if you can’t achieve that,
                        you can disagree with that premise. People have written books taking the
                        opposite point of view. But if you accept that premise, then you have to
                        simply say, as I said in my remarks, that the costs over time would have
                        just gotten greater and greater.</p>
                    <p>Our cause – there was nothing wrong with our cause in Vietnam. Those of us
                        who signed up or were sent there did not question our goal. But sometimes,
                        even the world’s greatest power can’t achieve its goal. And on that basis, I
                        think you have to evaluate policy. This is a very difficult problem, and
                        it’s never more difficult than when your soldiers are being shot at.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi>Ambassador Holbrooke, thank you so much for
                        your comments. I think the purpose of the foreign relations volumes is not
                        only to set the record straight, but to give us a digest of issues so that –
                        to help us in foreign policy decisions that we make later down the road. And
                        you were on the field in – on the ground in Vietnam, as you said, looking at
                        this through the portal of civilian – the civilian dimensions of the war,
                        like your task today. And it would be interesting to know, both positively
                        and negatively, what your experiences in doing that in Vietnam, how those
                        have affected the way you’ve organized your teams work today in
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:</hi> I was wondering how long we
                        could avoid that question. (Laughter.) And it has to be a friend who asks
                        it, right? Steve, that’s a – of course, I’ve thought about it a lot. And so
                        let me start by making a very simple statement about then and now.</p>
                    <p>There are many structural similarities between the two situations, but there
                        is a fundamental strategic difference. And there’s a fundamental difference
                        about how we got involved. In Afghanistan, we entered the war because we
                        were attacked in the most serious attack on American soil in history, and
                        the nation unanimously on a bipartisan basis, without any significant
                        dissent, myself certainly included, felt that we had to go into Afghanistan
                        because the people who were in charge of the country had sheltered Osama bin
                        Laden and al-Qaida and could not remain there. And whatever happened after
                        that, the root cause of our entry into Afghanistan was instantaneous, Pearl
                        Harbor- like and totally justified.</p>
                    <p>We slid into Vietnam accidentally. Little known fact, Eisenhower already had
                        advisory troops there before Kennedy became President. Eisenhower had told
                        the president-elect not only about Laos, in response to this gentleman’s
                        question, but also about the importance of Vietnam. It was Eisenhower who
                        laid out the domino theory which became the dominant metaphor of the war and
                        which turned out to be false. The dominoes didn’t fall unless you count
                        Cambodia and Laos, which were part of the strategic space.</p>
                    <p>And so we slid in a thousand soldiers under Eisenhower, at the time of
                        President Kennedy’s death, maybe 15,000, 16,000, at the time Lyndon Johnson
                        left office, over 500,000, and then the drawdowns that Henry described. So
                        we slid in.</p>
                    <p>Had people sat down and said, you know, we’re going to go in there, we’re
                        going to end up with 500,000 troops, I cannot imagine any administration,
                        any political system would have agreed to that intervention. But as Henry
                        pointed out, that’s the hand that they were dealt on January 20th, 1969. And
                        so that is a – that is the fundamental difference. But structurally there
                        are obvious similarities. And leafing through these books here, they leap
                        out at you. Many of the programs that are being followed, many of the basic
                        doctrines are the same ones that we were trying to apply in Vietnam. And I
                        believe in history. I think history is continuous. It doesn’t begin or end
                        on Pearl Harbor Day or the day Lyndon Johnson withdraws from the presidency
                        or on 9/11. You have to learn from the past but not be imprisoned by it. You
                        need to take counsel of history but never be imprisoned by it.</p>
                    <p>So this is not Vietnam, but there’s a lot to learn. And it’s not an accident
                        that David Petraeus, my counterpart for the first year-and-a-half of this
                        Administration, until he went back to Kabul, had written his Ph.D. thesis at
                        Princeton about this, about the war, and he and I have talked many times
                        about it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Hello. I’m Marty Phillips from the School
                        of Oriental and African Studies. I just want to draw a little on the first
                        question about informal diplomacy and also upon your perhaps work on
                        civilian impacts of the war early on. To what extent was the civilian
                        relationships that were constructed in Southeast Asia before perhaps the
                        Vietnam War in the early part of the ‘50s, ‘60s important such as the People
                        to People Program, the Peace Corps? And to what extent did those have an
                        impact on U.S. Foreign Policy?</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:</hi> I think that track two was very
                        – there are interesting track twos today in regard to several issues that
                        are ongoing in the U.S. Government. But the track two phrase wasn’t yet
                        heard of. The people who were doing it – there wasn’t a structure for it.
                        And I have no memory of any of these people making a difference except in
                        the case of somebody like Henry Kissinger and a handful of others whose
                        private diplomacy never revealed, never ending up on the op-ed page in The
                        New York Times, were the first indirect channels. And –</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> So maybe I could just –</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:</hi>– that’s a whole – but I don’t
                        think that this made much difference for policy. I’m not saying it was good
                        or bad, I’m just answering your question.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> I’m just wondering to what extent how
                        important you think the relationships between U.S. civilians, be it through
                        policies like the People-to-People Program from 1954 and with the Peace
                        Corps with local populations in Southeast Asian countries, how important
                        that was in forwarding U.S. policy during the period?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:</hi> You’re talking about Vietnam?
                        North Vietnam?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Well, I’m talking about Southeast Asia as a
                        whole.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:</hi> Well, Southeast Asia is
                        different. Other than North Vietnam we had very important relationships with
                        the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia. Japan was and remains our
                        most important ally in the Pacific. We didn’t yet have contacts yet with the
                        People’s Republic of China. And the people – I believe in people-to-people
                        diplomacy and contacts. I spent six years as Chairman of Asia Society
                        stimulating those. I really believe in them. But they – but vis-à-vis the
                        North Vietnamese, Hanoi between 1961 and 1973, I think very little except
                        for these special private channels that I mentioned earlier.</p>
                    <p>But I don’t want to discourage anyone in this room, people-to-people
                        diplomacy – it’s not really diplomacy it’s people-to-people communications
                        are always valuable whether it’s the cultural exchange programs that we all
                        love and which the State Department is reviving as much as they can within
                        the limits of our budget, exchange programs. These are tremendously valuable
                        and I’m a very strong supporter of the exchange programs including with the
                        military. I think bringing military officers to the United States from other
                        countries, while it carries some risks and has been the subject of a lot of
                        heated legislation is a net plus in growing ties. If you’re not in contact
                        with people, you lose touch and you begin to stigmatize them. So I love
                        those programs, but don’t confuse them with ending the war in Vietnam
                        because they didn’t play a role in that.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> One of the most heartbreaking –</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:</hi> Harry, stand up.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi>– (from Harry McPherson) I remember is the
                        one between Lyndon Johnson and Richard Russell in 1964, which is on the
                        Johnson tape. And both the new President and the Chairman of the Senate
                        Foreign Services Committee, a man who had always supported the large
                        American role in the world, both of them said this war is not worth the
                        death of one more American soldier. And Johnson said, “It makes me sick to
                        send anybody into this war.” Russell said, “Wars like this don’t matter
                        anymore. We and the Russians can blow each other up with missiles, with
                        atomic warheads. These little wars don’t matter.” Well, you listen for maybe
                        15, 20 minutes to this conversation and you think maybe something dramatic
                        is going to happen. But suddenly Johnson says, “But they would kill us if I
                        got out.” And “they” means the Republicans. It could have even meant Robert
                        Kennedy who was a very strong supporter of the war. And Johnson was always
                        apprehensive about where Kennedy would come out.</p>
                    <p>I have a question. We are all familiar with the dilemma of presidents caught
                        in this situation. There’s a huge argument today about whether, and there
                        will probably always be, about whether John Kennedy, had he remained
                        President, would have withdrawn from Vietnam. Always the danger is that
                        public opinion will be dramatically affected for the worse for the
                        President. Is that still the situation? After our experience in Vietnam, is
                        the current President and all other Presidents, are they forever doomed to
                        stay in once a commitment it seems to be called for because to pull out
                        would evidence cowardice or fecklessness?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:</hi> For those of you who didn’t
                        know who just asked the question, that’s Harry McPherson, who was my best
                        friend in the Johnson White House and one of LBJ’s closest advisors. And
                        this is a very important question with contemporary relevance. And Harry, I
                        would say no, I don’t think presidents are bound by that imperative. But
                        presidents, as you know better than anyone else in this room – you and Henry
                        because you’re the two people in the room who were closest to the two
                        presidents who played the key role in this drama we’re talking about today –
                        presidents are many different things at once. They’re commander-in-chief.
                        They’re chief executive of the federal bureaucracy. They are the leaders of
                        the country and symbolic in specific ways. And they’re also head of their
                        party. And no president can disaggregate those issues.</p>
                    <p>We don’t – I don’t worry about those issues. We have our job. Our job is the
                        civilian part of the effort in Afghanistan and Pakistan. And a lot of my
                        team are here today. I’m very proud of them. Many of you in this room know
                        them. They’re the best team I’ve ever had. But we don’t sit around talking
                        about that issue. We sit around trying to figure out how to make the
                        civilian programs work as well as they can. And here, by the way, the
                        lessons for me personally – the lessons of – that people like Vladimir and I
                        had in the Mekong Delta working for Rufus are very relevant. Rufus taught us
                        how to drill wells which, by the way, you, Rufus, didn’t know how to do
                        either. (Laughter.) So that’s our job. We don’t sit around debating that
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>But if you’re the President of the United States and you’re in the situation
                        room, whether you’re named Johnson or Nixon or Ford or George W. Bush or
                        Barack Obama, whoever you are as President, you have to integrate all these
                        things. You know that. And people are coming at you from every direction.
                        That’s why we always talk about the loneliness of the presidency at the
                        moment of decision. These are tough decisions. And having had the privilege
                        of sitting there watching President Obama coming into office and immediately
                        on the second day in office having to confront these issues because the
                        military said we need more troops immediately, immediately – and there was
                        no choice. If you don’t give them, we’re out of it.</p>
                    <p>I’m talking about the first 21,000. Then coming back with an unexpected
                        request from General McChrystal for an additional 40,000 and confronting
                        every option that the American public was debating publicly, we were aware
                        of every pro, every con, every up side, every down side. And you know, but
                        he has to make the final decision under our system of government. To be
                        sure, it requires the support of the American people. It requires the
                        support of the Congress. That’s the essence of a successful foreign policy.
                        And in Vietnam, in the end, the public was lost.</p>
                    <p>But to go to the core of your question having set the predicate, no, the
                        President is not bound by that single imperative, but it is a legitimate
                        factor that has to be considered.</p>
                    <p>Oh, a friendly –</p>

                        I’m a Vietnam War correspondent, and I also covered the ambassador when he
                        was at the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>You have an incredibly unique perspective on the world from your career. And
                        we’ve been listening to a lot of questions and statements about the lessons
                        of the Vietnam War. And I wonder if you could look at not only your job
                        today but the rest of the world and sort of tell us whether you think the
                        lessons of the Vietnam War are being remembered, or are they perhaps being
                        forgotten. And are there possibly some Vietnams lurking in the future?</p>
                    <p><hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:</hi> Well, Edie, it’s good to see you
                        again. And of course, I think the retrospective on Vietnam is going through
                        many cycles, but people don’t talk about it a lot anymore in the level of
                        detail we’re going to be talking about it here for the next two days. They
                        talk about it in metaphoric terms; we can’t have another Vietnam. Or
                        alternatively, we would have won in Vietnam if we’d put in more military
                        force, more military pressure. Rufus addresses this in his book, <hi
                            rend="italic">Why Vietnam Matters</hi>, which I strongly recommend to
                        you. But don’t overdo the lessons of history, but learn from them.</p>
                    <p>I do not believe that you’re going to solve today’s problems by having
                        another debate about what went right and what didn’t go right in Vietnam.
                        It’s just not possible. You can’t extrapolate from Southeast Asia in 1965 to
                        South Asia in 2010. But you can learn a lot by respecting history, and
                        that’s why we’re here today.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">MODERATOR:</hi> I have to play the role of grim
                        timekeeper, so one more question – short – question and not a statement.
                        Thank you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi>When you were helping to write the speech in
                        which Lyndon Johnson announced the narrowing of the bombing of North
                        Vietnam, was there any awareness when the speech was being written that what
                        was going to happen was that there would be more bombing just restricted to
                        a narrower section of North Vietnam? And if there was no thought at all of
                        this when the speech was being written, what was the reaction in the White
                        House when that turned out to be? What happened? What happened?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:</hi> Gosh, that’s a really good
                        question and it goes to the level of detail that I was going to avoid here.
                        (Laughter.) But because it’s so deep in my heart, I would like to address
                        it. And speaking very personally about it, Harry McPherson may have a
                        different view because he was a primary drafter of the speech, whereas I was
                        just chatting with Harry about some details.</p>
                    <p>To be sure everyone understands the importance of the question, confronted
                        with an incredible domestic crisis, and prior to withdrawing, we are
                        designing the speech. I’m the smallest fry in the room, but Harry is the
                        primary drafter. But Harry doesn’t know the end of the speech; this is
                        critical. Harry does not know that Lyndon Johnson’s going to withdraw. And
                        the President decides to cut a compromise between stopping the bombing
                        entirely and continuing the bombing. He is confronted with a request from
                        General Westmoreland for an additional 206,000 troops. We’re going to 550;
                        Westy wants over 750,000 troops.</p>
                    <p>And so LBJ decides, on advice of everyone from the Secretary of State to the
                        Ambassador – Ellsworth Bunker – in Saigon, he decides, to narrow the
                        bombing, as you said, to – the southern neck of North Vietnam. so he’ll bomb
                        only up to the 20th parallel, instead of going all the way up to
                        Hanoi-Haiphong, as had been the case.</p>
                    <p>And then he withdraws and says he – in the same speech, and says he wants to
                        give the rest of his presidency to the cause of peace. I can’t speak for
                        Harry, but I can tell you that had I realized he was not going to run again,
                        and that meant he had only nine or ten months left in his presidency, I
                        would have said this is nuts; if you’re going to make the gesture, stop it
                        all.</p>
                    <p>So what happened? We get the Vietnamese answer, four days later, and the same
                        day Martin Luther King Jr. was killed, and the same day the streets of the
                        city on 16th Street are aflame, and you can see it as you cross the Key
                        Bridge. And it is hard to imagine the drama in the city. And the same day,
                        the North Vietnamese send us a message that they’re ready to have talks with
                        us, but only on ending the rest of the bombing. The headlines, which are not
                        the big headline of the day because of the riots going on in Washington and
                        all over the country and the unbelievable drama of Martin Luther King’s
                        assassination.</p>
                    <p>The responses – we went from one month arguing about where we’re going to
                        have the talks. They want them in Warsaw, we want them in Geneva. President
                        Johnson says I’ll go anywhere except Paris. (Laughter.) He didn’t trust the
                        French, so we ended up in Paris, which was perfectly fine with us. I’d
                        rather live in Paris for a year than Geneva anyway. Somebody even suggested
                        an Indonesian ship. It was wild. For one month while people are fighting,
                        we’re arguing about where to go.</p>
                    <p>In early May, the advance team arrives. John Negroponte (who's out of the
                        room temporarily) was part of the advance team. And Harriman and Rusk, and
                        Habib, and about 10 of us start the negotiations. The North Vietnamese say,
                        “We will only talk to you about cessation of the rest of the bombing.” And
                        we say, “No, we want to talk about the whole war.” They say no. This is all
                        very public. They say, “No, we got to talk about just the bombing, and when
                        you stop the bombing, then we’ll talk about other things.”</p>
                    <p>And this drives Harriman and Vance, who really want to try to use the time to
                        end the war, nuts. But the ambassador in Saigon, a formidable man named
                        Ellsworth Bunker, and the national security adviser, Walt Rostow, take a
                        very hard line. My first boss, Nick Katzenbach, I mentioned earlier, joins
                        the new Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford in pushing the Harriman-Vance
                        line, and the U.S. Government comes to a deep split, and the summer drifts
                        away.</p>
                    <p>With the tragedy of Robert F. Kennedy, [who] enters the race – he’s killed in
                        Los Angeles – we had a summer that was unbelievable in drama. We had the
                        Chicago Convention – Henry Kissinger and I are sitting on the beach in
                        Martha’s Vineyard, during the Chicago Convention. Remember? And we're
                        talking, and Henry, to support what he said earlier, says to me – watching
                        this destruction of the Democratic Party in Chicago and Nixon having the
                        nomination – says, “This is the end of me. Nelson Rockefeller and Hubert
                        Humphrey are being destroyed. I’ll never serve in the government again.”
                        (Laughter.) Henry? As he said earlier, he really said it; I was there.</p>
                    <p>And so for those of you who don't remember this, there's never been a year
                        like ‘68 in our lives. And so the summer drifts on and Hubert Humphrey is
                        desperate for us to move forward. Lyndon Johnson is torn; he doesn’t know
                        whether to hand off the war intact to his successor, or make a gesture for
                        peace which would require him to stop all the bombing. Dean Rusk finally
                        comes up with the solution – a very elegant, logistical solution. Since
                        Hanoi will not agree to what will follow the talks, and we – will follow the
                        cessation of the rest of the bombing, and we won’t agree to stop
                        unilaterally, Dean Rusk comes up with a very artful, very artful way of
                        phrasing it: “We are ready to consider the bombing, to stop all the bombing
                        on the firm expectation that X, Y, and Z will occur.”</p>
                    <p>And this is why it’s fun sometimes to be a diplomat, because sometimes a
                        diplomat can make a difference, and in this case it was Secretary Rusk who
                        did. And with that compromise, we go to the Vietnamese five days before the
                        1968 election. And President Johnson, five days before the ‘68 election,
                        announces the cessation of all the bombing, and this gets completely mixed
                        up with the presidential campaign in ways that I’m not going to revisit here
                        because they’ve been written about in many books and remain extremely
                        controversial. And Richard Nixon wins this election by less than 500,000
                        votes. And remember, there was a third-party candidate in the race, George
                        Wallace.</p>
                    <p>And therefore, his [Johnson’s] presidency ends without having used the
                        gesture. So it’s my view that this was a classic case of not integrating the
                        policy. Going back to the earlier question about, to Harry’s question, about
                        presidential role – I think it, I don’t know if you agree, Harry – but had
                        we known that Lyndon Johnson was going to end his career, we would have said
                        to him, end all the bombing too and use the next 10 months to negotiate. So
                        he loses his window and passes the mess on to the next administration, never
                        testing whether we could have actually made negotiating progress.</p>
                    <p>So I can say, in the annals of tragedies in American diplomacy, the failure
                        to integrate the political side of the brain with the policy side, lost us
                        an entire year and made the next administration’s task all the more
                        difficult. And it's just a heartbreak, and that's a lesson I’ve always had
                        with me for the rest of my life in everything else I’ve ever done.</p>
                    <p>(Applause.)</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">DR. CARLAND:</hi> Okay. Could we settle down? Welcome to
                        the afternoon session of our conference on the American Experience in
                        Southeast Asia 1946-1975. The panel we are about to start right now is
                        called the View from Hanoi, Historians from the Socialist Republic of
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Before I introduce the chair, I want to say something about the origins of
                        the panel. We knew when we began planning the program that we could put on a
                        good conference about the United States and the Vietnam War, but we knew we
                        could do a better one if we could obtain the participation from scholars
                        from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Through the efforts of a large
                        number of institutions in our government and the Government of Vietnam, the
                        Historian’s Office here, the Education and Cultural Affairs Bureau, the
                        Vietnam desk, Embassy Hanoi, the military Ministry of Defense in Hanoi, the
                        Ministry of Foreign Affairs from Hanoi, and the Vietnamese Embassy here, it
                        all worked out. And we are the recipients of all that hard work, and I think
                        it’s going to be a wonderful session.</p>
                    <p>The person who’s going to chair and introduce the panel is Ronald Spector
                        from George Washington University. Ron has had a distinguished career in the
                        academic world, his research focusing mostly on the United States and Asia,
                        and in the official world, working formerly at the United States Army Center
                        of Military History, where I also worked at one time, and as the first
                        civilian Director of Naval History. He’s the author of several books, among
                        them, <hi rend="italic">After Tet: The Bloodiest Year in the Vietnam
                            War</hi>. Ron is currently Class of 1957 Distinguished Visiting Chair in
                        Naval History at the U.S. Naval Academy. In addition to all this, he also
                        served with the United States Marine Corps in Vietnam, 1968-69.</p>
                    <p>Ron.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROFESSOR SPECTOR</hi>: Thank you. Thank you, John. I’ve
                        been asked to remind you that you – English is on Channel 1, and Vietnamese
                        is on Channel 5 – 6 – 2. I was close. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>If I may begin this panel on a personal note, I’m one of those old people
                        that Mr. Kissinger referred to who lived through the whole thing. I was in
                        Vietnam in ’68-’69. I did not meet any policymakers. I didn’t know any
                        celebrity journalists. But I did have the distinction of receiving an
                        invitation from Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, who was the U.S. ambassador at
                        the time. Ambassador Bunker decided to form a chapter of the Yale Club in
                        Saigon. (Laughter.) And I was invited to an organizational meeting of the
                        Yale Club in Saigon. At the time, I was about, I guess, 400 miles north of
                        Saigon. But I was very pleased with this invitation and I took it to the
                        sergeant, and I said, “Gunny, look. The ambassador invited me to Saigon. I
                        have to go to Saigon.” And he looked at this thoughtfully for a minute or
                        two, and finally he said, “Ah, you’re always coming up with crazy stuff like
                        that.”</p>
                    <p>So I never did make it to Saigon. But I have to say that many of my friends
                        and contemporaries who served in Vietnam who have, of course, many
                        misgivings and unhappy memories and sometimes not very good feelings about
                        the Vietnam War, I venture to say they would all still be pleased to know
                        that the State Department Historical Office has completed this great task of
                        compiling the official records of the United States in the war so that, for
                        the first time, the American people can see in detail what was said, done,
                        and what was not done.</p>
                    <p>With that, I’d like to go ahead and introduce our panel. Those of you who are
                        historians working on the war know that one of the characteristics of
                        American scholarship about Vietnam is the almost microscopic interest in
                        American decision-making at the highest levels in Washington and Saigon. And
                        if you read many of the books about the Vietnam War, it seems as if the
                        important thing is presidential decision-making and events in Vietnam were
                        sort of relegated to background noise, and then there’s certainly very
                        little consideration of what the other side was doing. And I’ve – at a
                        number of meetings, I’ve sometimes observed that the emphasis of American
                        scholarship on Vietnam reminds me of the story about General Pickett, who
                        was asked by a British diplomat after the Civil War to what he attributed
                        the failure of the Confederates at Gettysburg. And General Pickett replied,
                        “Well, I kind of think the Yankees had something to do with it.”</p>
                    <p>So today, we – I think we’ll hear the other, the other, perspective on the
                        war, and it is a great pleasure to introduce Ambassador Tran Van Tung, who
                        received his Bachelor’s Degree from Havana University in ’72. He entered the
                        Ministry of Foreign Affairs in that year. And he has held various positions
                        in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and also served abroad in Sri Lanka,
                        India, Australia, and Myanmar. From 1996 to 1999, he was Vietnam’s
                        ambassador to Australia, and from 2005 to 2008, he was the ambassador to
                        Myanmar. Since 2009, he has been director of the Diplomatic History Research
                        Center in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and he is coauthor of the
                        forthcoming study, The History of Vietnam’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
                        1945 to 2002.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Tung.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR TUNG:</hi> Mr. Chairman, distinguished
                        (inaudible) ladies and gentlemen, may I first of all express my sincere
                        thanks to the ECA [Economic and Cultural Affairs Bureau], the Department of
                        State, for their kind invitation extended to me to participate in September
                        conference on the American Experience in Southeast Asia 1946-1975. This
                        gives me an opportunity to visit the United States of America and
                        Washington, D.C. that has worldwide reputation with international flair and
                        a rich cultural life, a capital that attracts worldwide attention in all
                        times in view of its importance and stature.</p>
                    <p>The conference is significantly organized at a time when Vietnam and the
                        United States just celebrated the 15th anniversary of the normalization of
                        the relations between the two countries and the 10th anniversary of the
                        signing of the bilateral trade agreement. Over the past 15 years, the
                        multisided Vietnam-U.S. relations have developed very fast. With the visits
                        and meetings of the leaders of the two nations from 1988 up to now, the
                        United States has been the seventh biggest investor in Vietnam with U.S.
                        dollars, 15.8 billion. And in 19 – and in 2009, it became Vietnam’s biggest
                        investor. In terms of trade, the United States is Vietnam’s biggest importer
                        among 200 countries and territories.</p>
                    <p>Along with this investment and trade, the United States has introduced into
                        Vietnam a large amount, a large amount, of capital, namely the modern
                        technology and science, the advanced management, and the industrial style of
                        work, which would greatly be beneficial to Vietnam. With more than 1.5
                        millions of Vietnamese living in the United States and around 13,000
                        Vietnamese students studying here, and a large number of the U.S. visas to
                        Vietnam annually, they all contribute significantly to the mutual
                        understanding and the Vietnam-U.S. bilateral relations.</p>
                    <p>Most recently, Secretary of State, her – Secretary Hillary Clinton, visited
                        Vietnam. Her visit ushered in a new stage to enhance the U.S.-Vietnam
                        relations to a new dimension that would be wider, stronger, and deeper. Just
                        a few days ago in New York, President Nguyen Minh Triet and President Barack
                        Obama co-chaired the U.S.-ASEAN partnership meeting aimed at heightening the
                        U.S.-ASEAN cooperation to a new level. This speaks for all and manifests the
                        will of the Vietnamese and American peoples to close the past and to forge
                        ahead their bilateral relations to a new momentum in the interests of the
                        two nations, and of peace and cooperation in the region.</p>
                    <p>As time passes, the Vietnam War became the past forever. In the light of this
                        spirit, I wish to present my paper relating the past war, which is aimed at
                        drawing lessons for a young generation in both countries to avoid this
                        episode. My paper is <hi rend="italic">Vietnam-U.S. Relations During a
                            Turning Point of the Vietnam War</hi>. The relations between the DRV and
                        the United States of America from 1946 to the end of the Vietnam War in
                        April 1975 was basically hostile except a short period in 1945 and 1946.
                        There was a limited cooperation between the two countries in disarming the
                        Japanese troops in Indochina.</p>
                    <p>By that time, the United States implemented the noninvolvement policy while
                        the provincial government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wanted the
                        United States to recognize its independence, to extend its scientific and
                        technological assistance to Vietnam, and to support Vietnam’s admission to
                        the United Nations. All the then-efforts of the DRV were, however, not
                        turned out as Vietnam expected to get. The United States and Vietnam were
                        loggerheads with each other in a new and strange world, which had had no
                        precedence in the contemporary history of war. That was a war between a
                        small, poor, and backward country against the mightiest country, which was
                        absolute superior to Vietnam in terms of economy, defense, science, and
                        technology.</p>
                    <p>Within the limited framework of my paper, I have no ambition to present the
                        overall relations between Vietnam and the United States during the Vietnam
                        War. Instead, I wish to mention partial relationships in a turning point
                        when both countries changed their respective strategies to put an end to the
                        war, in keeping with each other’s strategic attempts to enter into talks, to
                        seek political settlement for the Vietnam issue, namely in 1965, 1966, and
                        1967, and a part of the Paris talks on ending the war and restoring peace in
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>The situation in the United States, in Vietnam, and in the world during the
                        period from 1964 to 1967 was routed with various corridors that so attracted
                        the world’s attention, especially those historians specializing in writing
                        war history. In the United States, the economy by then was very strong. The
                        society was stable. Both the houses [i.e., the Senate and the House of
                        Representatives] had attitudes in favor of the policy of the President
                        Johnson’s government. With overwhelming military force, the U.S. Government
                        held that they would easily win the war. No sooner succeeding President
                        Kennedy and throughout 1964 had President Johnson prepared a plan to step up
                        and expand – to expand to the war in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>In February 1964, President Johnson approved a secret reconnaissance plan to
                        grasp the situation in North Vietnam. In March 1964, National Security
                        Advisor Rostow worked out a plan to – for escalation of war to North
                        Vietnam. In June 1964, the White House key advisors met in Honolulu to
                        discuss military and political measures to be taken against North and South
                        Vietnam, including a plan to bomb North Vietnam by air force and
                        introduction of 5,000 military personnel into South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>In November 1964, the National Security Council worked out a plan to attack
                        Laos and North Vietnam. This plan was approved by President Johnson and his
                        key advisors in December, 1964. In order to carry out the aforesaid plans
                        from February 1965, the United States shifted from the Special War to the
                        Local War. This marked a change of strategy in the Vietnam War by the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>During three years of 1965, 1966, and 1967, the United States introduced
                        massively the U.S. and its allied troops, consisted of South Korea,
                        Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, into South Vietnam to
                        engage in direct combat. There was over half a million of troops at the peak
                        of the war. The United States stepped up war of destruction against North
                        Vietnam by air and labor forces, with an attempt to diminish fighting
                        strength of the South Vietnamese people, to break the Viet Cong’s backbone,
                        to erase the role of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, to
                        strengthen the Saigon army, and to decrease aid from North to the South to
                        create position of strength, to intensify where, when necessary, and when
                        necessary to conduct talks on the position of strength, thus forcing Vietnam
                        enter into talks in accordance with the U.S. conditions.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. intensification of the war was not only aimed at not allowing South
                        Vietnam fall into the hands of Communists, but also showing the Soviet Union
                        and China its resolve to prevent Communism from spreading to Southeast Asia.
                        Vietnam was, in reality, not the U.S. important strategic area. The United
                        States, however, sent a big military force to this region, and accompanying
                        them were all kinds of the most sophisticated weapons by that time, except
                        A-bombs, a large amount of money, and even the U.S. prestige, for the sake
                        of the U.S. global strategy. That is to say to prevent Communism from
                        spreading to South Asia, to crush the national liberation movement of which
                        Vietnam was the leading flag.</p>
                    <p>The United States was therefore resolved to win. If it suffered military
                        failures, it would make strong impact on the U.S. internal affairs, and it
                        would affect seriously its global strategy. The United States stepped up and
                        expanded the war to both North and South Vietnam in the context where the
                        United States have already suffered defeat in the Special War in South
                        Vietnam, and it was compelled to push up the war to a new stage. By stepping
                        up and expanding the war, the United States had to put an eye to reaction
                        from China, the Soviet Union, the world public opinion, and the U.S.
                        opinion. Coupled with military operations, the United States opened up the
                        biggest and the longest peace campaign during President Johnson’s
                        presidency, which started by the president’s speech at Baltimore in April 7,
                        1965, and demanded unconditional talks. The peace campaign was, in reality,
                        to make capital of the USSR-China contradictions, the psychology of fear of
                        the U.S. might [unclear] perception regarding President Johnson’s peace
                        campaign, with a view to covering up the activities of intensifying and
                        expanding the war, forcing Vietnam to talk according to the U.S.
                        conditions.</p>
                    <p>In the world in this period, contradictions and differences of viewpoints in
                        the international Communist and workers movement, chiefly between the USSR
                        and China, were very grave, leading to this interpretation, especially the
                        differences on the Vietnam issue effect that no less small on the resistance
                        war of the Vietnamese people. In October 1964, Secretary General Khrushchev
                        was brought down. The new leadership in the USSR paid more attention to the
                        Vietnam issue. The USSR and other East European countries, although
                        supported Vietnam, they feared that Vietnam could not stand up the war
                        enriched by the United States. They had even no confidence in Vietnam to
                        defeat the American militarily. They advised Vietnam not to fight, instead
                        to enter into talks to find out peaceful solutions for the Vietnam
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>In the same year, China made public new diplomatic policy, whose salient
                        substance was that if the United States did not touch China, China would not
                        touch the United States. The newly independent countries like Ghana, Zambia,
                        Tanzania, Malawi, Sierra Leone, Uganda, et cetera had similar viewpoints
                        with the USSR and the other East European countries. The opinion of the
                        Western countries was that they feared Vietnam could not stand up [to]the
                        U.S. military might, especially when the hawks threatened to turn North
                        Vietnam to the Stone Age. They held that the United States had – possess
                        A-bombs. If the United States used tactical A-bombs, Vietnam was doomed to
                        total destruction.</p>
                    <p>The popular psychology prevailing in the world in those days was a threat of
                        U.S. might, a threat of the Vietnam War would be expanded to world war. In
                        Vietnam, immediately after President Johnson entered the White House, and
                        especially in the wake of the Tonkin Gulf incident in August 1964, in
                        September 1964 the Politburo of the Vietnam Workers’ Party arrived – met and
                        arrived at an assessment that currently, our people were facing a danger of
                        the adversary’s aggression. The whole country had to concentrate all
                        strengths to defeat the adversary. The diplomatic activities had to win over
                        solidarity of all forces opposing aggression, to befriend more people.
                        Support and solidarity of the entire socialist camp were of paramount
                        importance.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the state of war, the Politburo reaffirmed that sooner or later,
                        the United States would expand the war to the North and advocated to defeat
                        the Saigon puppet army before the U.S. jump in. The party Central Committee
                        already reviewed a general offensive plan, however. By that time, the
                        military and political forces were not able to meet the demands for a
                        general offensive. The plan was therefore cancelled.</p>
                    <p>From December 1964, the United States actively explored the Vietnam’s
                        attitude. The party Central Committee advocated not to have contacts with
                        our adversary, to keep top secret our strategic intention, and at the same
                        time to express our idea to the Americans to get to know the Vietnamese
                        people’s determination to fight against them through to the end. In the
                        North, the year of 1965 was the best year in terms of economic production,
                        chiefly the agricultural production and the local industries. Those
                        achievements helped increase the North’s capability to give aid to the
                        South.</p>
                    <p>In South Vietnam, by beginning of 1965, the United States met with failure in
                        the Special War. The Saigon administration faced a danger of collapse. The
                        United States had to send its troops and the allies ones to take part in
                        direct combat. In face of that situation, the Politburo came to an
                        estimation that the whole country embarked on a state of war. The South was
                        the great vanguard front; the North was the great rear area.</p>
                    <p>The North should shift from peacetime economy to wartime economy, doing
                        production while fighting. Ideology and organization should be reorientated
                        to be adaptable to wartime situation. That constituted a new stage in the
                        Vietnamese revolution, a grave ordeal for the Vietnamese people. The party
                        Central Committee asserted that military victory in the battlefield would be
                        decisive. The whole nation was resolved to fight the adversary’s will of
                        aggression. The Vietnamese people were determined to fight and to defeat the
                        adversary troops, both in South and North Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>We fought in the three fronts all together – military, political, and
                        diplomatic. In doing so, Vietnam should always be cautious and was prepared
                        to fight any kind of war, but also to keep the war within limitation and to
                        be master of our strategy, be resolved to fight and to win. And at the same
                        time, we did not want to make anyone worried. Only in doing so could we be
                        able to win over sympathy and support of all. The diplomatic activities
                        should be focused to expose the adversary’s crimes and to show our stern
                        attitude not to mention talks.</p>
                    <p>In April 10th, 1965, at the National Assembly’s legislature, President Ho Chi
                        Minh called upon the entire Vietnamese people to stand up to fight the
                        adversary. Prime Minister Pham Van Dong presented his report on the
                        four-point position of the DRV’s government. This four-point position should
                        be a ways for a correct political solution to the Vietnamese issue. With the
                        statement of President Ho Chi Minh and the four-point position, Vietnam was
                        prepared to accept an imbalanced fight against the richest and the mightiest
                        country in the world, to accept the U.S. challenge.</p>
                    <p>During the three years from 1965 to ’67, the war entered into the fiercest
                        stage. It was also the time that the United States urged Vietnam to accept
                        its unconditional talks proposal, and presently campaigned many countries
                        and people to put pressure on Vietnam to accept talks. The U.S. position in
                        those years was to stop bombing North Vietnam with conditions. That is to
                        say North Vietnam stop its military operations in South Vietnam. The United
                        States withdraw its troops from South Vietnam with conditions, too. That is,
                        the North had to withdraw its armed forces from the South, the Liberation
                        Army ought to be disbanded, the United States ought to be ensured that they
                        fully controlled the Saigon administration.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Saigon
                        administration, the National Liberation Front could participate in the
                        talks, but not because of that. It was on an equal footing position with the
                        Saigon administration. It must be concluded that there were two key issues
                        in the U.S. position, namely the armed forces and the administration. When
                        the United States introduced its massive troops into South Vietnam, and –
                        which were of destruction against North Vietnam, the Vietnamese people were
                        prepared to accept a longer, harsher, and more sacrificed war. Their
                        determination was to fight through to the end, to fight until no invader was
                        present on the Vietnamese side. They were resolved to defeat the adversary.
                        That was a strategic intention of the entire Vietnamese people. The United
                        States wanted to defeat Vietnam in South Vietnam. And Vietnam was determined
                        to defeat its adversary in South Vietnam. That was a fierce rival with
                        regard to the will and resolve of a small nation against a superpower to
                        gain independence, freedom, and to defend national sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>By defeating the adversary, Vietnam would contribute to the struggle against
                        imperialism and say regard of world peace, would come to a conclusion for
                        the national liberation movement from the Vietnamese practice, would clear
                        doubts from many countries, including a number of the socialist countries.
                        They were doubtful whether Vietnam could defeat the adversary. By defeating
                        the adversary within the Vietnamese territory, Vietnam could dismiss fear
                        that Vietnam War might be expanded to world war.</p>
                    <p>With regard to Vietnam from beginning of 1965 to 1967, the Central Committee
                        of the Vietnamese Workers Party adopted three resolutions, namely Resolution
                        11 in February 1965, Resolution 12 in December 1965, and Resolution 13 in
                        January 1970 – ’67. Each resolution marked a milestone of diplomatic attack.
                        Those resolutions of the party Central Committee assigned Vietnam diplomacy
                        with tasks for this period. That is to say, to make correct assessment of
                        the situation. The strong (inaudible) of our adversary to wage struggle
                        against them, so as to lend support to the military and political activities
                        of the South Vietnamese people. By this time, the MOFA’s [Ministry of
                        Foreign Affair’s] observation was the current situation did not allow the
                        United States to use all their economic and military power for the war
                        against Vietnam. The U.S. fundamental witness was political field.
                        Diplomatic activities put into practice the guideline to incorporate Vietnam
                        in the world.</p>
                    <p>The Vietnam diplomacy’s leading task was to consolidate its strategic allies
                        to win over great – and assist great support and assistance of the USSR and
                        China, the socialist countries, despite the fact that the contradictions
                        between the USSR and China were to the extent of hostilities, to unite the
                        three Indochinese countries, to mobilize broad support of the world people
                        to the Vietnamese people’s struggle. The Central Committee Resolution 11
                        stated that efforts had to be made to contain and to defeat the adversary in
                        the Special War in South Vietnam. Forces had to be concentrated to gain
                        decisive victory in the South and, at the same time, to defeat the Local War
                        in the South. Defense had to be fostered.</p>
                    <p>We determined to defeat war of destruction and blockade by the air and naval
                        forces against the North. We prepared to defeat the adversary in case they
                        conducted local war in both North and South Vietnam. All endeavors ought to
                        be made to give aid to the South and the Laotian revolution. In 1965, the
                        United States pushed up our special war to momentum. It was, in reality, the
                        local war. The Vietnam Workers’ Party’s First Secretary Le Duan said that we
                        were not afraid of the Americans. We were even resolved to fight the
                        Americans, but also knew how to talk.</p>
                    <p>In order to cope with the Americans on the military front, Vietnam was
                        determined to foil the adversary’s attempt and the will of aggression so as
                        to gain military victory in the battlefield. At the beginning of U.S.
                        massive introduction of troops into South Vietnam, the high command of the
                        Vietnam People’s Army held various (inaudible) to discuss on what measures
                        to be taken on how to fight the U.S. troops. They were resolved to defeat
                        the U.S. troops, but they did not arrive at conclusion on how to fight.
                        General Nguyen Chi Thanh said that we would start – had to have fight and
                        then draw experience later.</p>
                    <p>Then the South Vietnam repression armed forces decided to attack a number of
                        American units as tests, including famous (inaudible) Thanh battlefield in
                        May 27, 1965, where U.S. conventional company was wiped out. And then to Van
                        Tuong in August 18, 1965, as most well know, mobile battlefield in November
                        22nd, 1965, where both sides engaged in division level combat. As result,
                        the U.S. division suffered heavy losses. The Liberation Army also attacked
                        various airfields, too. After conducting a number of fights as example,
                        Vietnam arrived at a conclusion that the American army was not invincible.
                        From then on, there rose up a movement to attack American troops throughout
                        South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>For diplomacy, the leading task was to get support and assistance from the
                        socialist camp, and in April 1965, the party’s central secretary – first
                        secretary Le Duan visited the USSR and China. In conclusion of those visits,
                        joint statements in support of Vietnam were issued. Those visits meant the
                        Communist parties in various Western countries changed their attitude in the
                        direction of lending support to Vietnam. In October 1965, Prime Minister
                        Pham Van Dong visited China and the Soviet Union, where he had discussions
                        with the leaders of these two countries on aid and cooperation in the
                        political struggle. In China, he asked for army volunteers. The Chinese
                        leaders agreed to send personnel volunteers, not army volunteers. There was
                        difference between army volunteers and personnel volunteers.</p>
                    <p>In the wake of the aforesaid visits, the material assistance and military aid
                        from the Soviet Union, China, and the socialist countries increased. Coupled
                        with the support and assistance from the socialist camp, Vietnam diplomacy
                        had to make clear its strategic determination and tactics, and not let the
                        war to expand beyond Vietnam border to forge the socialist solidarities. In
                        the past war of resistance against colonialism, the Vietnamese leaders
                        always attached importance to the solidarity among the Vietnamese – among
                        the peoples of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Vietnam considered it a
                        strategic issue.</p>
                    <p>On March 22nd, 1965, Vietnam organized Indochinese People’s Conference.
                        Together with the strengthening of the strategic relations with Laos and
                        Cambodia, Vietnam diplomatic activities were aimed at pushing up activities
                        of the world people’s movement, including the American people, to support
                        Vietnam. By this time, the Vietnam War became a big and leading issue in
                        international political life. Vietnam diplomats see, therefore – always made
                        clear that Vietnamese people’s struggle had closely been associated with the
                        movement of the world people and with the national liberation movement in
                        opposition to war of aggression. Diplomatic service campaigned for convening
                        an international conference in solidarity with and in support to the
                        Vietnamese people.</p>
                    <p>In March 22nd in 1965, the South Vietnam National Liberation Front issued a
                        five-point declaration. Ultimately, this declaration contained only one
                        point. That is to say, to fight through to the end, to fight until there
                        would be no invader present in South Vietnam’s soil.</p>
                    <p>In April 8, 1965, the DRV government made public a four-point position. This
                        four-point position was a strategy, a political solution to the issue of
                        both North and South Vietnam. The key point of this four-point position was
                        to liberate the South, not to repeat the state of affairs when the Geneva
                        Agreement had been signed in 1954. When the Vietnamese Government’s
                        four-point position was issued, the party Politburo gave directive to firmly
                        keep the flag of independence and uphold the flag of peace. In April 1965,
                        Prime Minister Pham Van Dong attended the 10th anniversary of the Bandung
                        Conference, where he presented the Vietnamese Government’s four-point
                        position. And in June 1965, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign
                        Affairs Nguyen Duy Trinh paid visits to various African countries to present
                        the four-point position and campaigned for recognition of the South Vietnam
                        National Liberation Front, and praised highly.</p>
                    <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
                    <p>All the matters had to be solved in accordance to the program of the South
                        Vietnam National Liberation Front. In December, 1965, the party’s Central
                        Committee adopted resolution. The fundamental substance of this resolution
                        was to defeat – to defend the North, to liberate the South, and to reunify
                        the country.</p>
                    <p>Well, I’m sorry. Mr. Chairman reminded me that there was a very short period
                        of time. So I will cut short my paper. My paper is already in the
                        network.</p>
                    <p>So with regard to the Paris talks, the Vietnam and the United States talks in
                        Paris was the longest and the most difficult one in the history of the
                        Vietnam diplomacy. By signing the Paris agreement on ending war and
                        restoring peace in Vietnam, the United States was committed to withdraw all
                        American troops from South Vietnam. Vietnam thus put into practice President
                        Ho Chi Minh’s prediction to fight the American until they quit. And more
                        than two years later, Vietnam brought down the Saigon administration by the
                        Ho Chi Minh Campaign in spring 1975, and achieved complete victory,
                        liberating the South and reunifying the country.</p>
                    <p>The situation at the start of 1967 showed that Vietnam should cope with the
                        U.S. peace campaign. Vietnam was of the opinion that the U.S. unconditional
                        talks proposal had been a diplomatic ploy. The United States wanted to – in
                        reality, only to talk on the position of strength and in pursuance of their
                        conditions. It did not really want to talk to reach a correct resolution, a
                        solution to the Vietnam issue. The party Central Committee planned,
                        therefore, to attack at the weakness of the United States, namely through
                        South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>In December 1967, the Central Committee still estimated that the adversary’s
                        will of aggression not – had not been (inaudible). Its attempt to occupy
                        South Vietnam had not been changed. That was why the specific conditions for
                        talks were not ripe. However, through mutual exploration of attitude between
                        the United States and the DRV, Vietnam did not rule out the possibility to
                        conduct talks, provided that the principle of the ending decisive military
                        victory in the battlefield should be ensured. The situation was not ripe
                        because the United States had been too strong. Its will to crush the South
                        Vietnamese people’s liberation movement had not been (inaudible). Talks
                        would only be conducted when the military front gained victory. We could not
                        achieve diplomatic success without military victory, said Resolution 12.</p>
                    <p>In March 1966, President Ho Chi Minh said diplomacy is very important, but
                        the main capital is that we must defeat them and we must gain strength. From
                        the very beginning to the end, Vietnam’s unswerving position was to gain
                        decisive military victory in the battlefield and to foil the adversary’s
                        will of aggression. By that time, among the socialist countries, first and
                        foremost the Soviet Union and China, engaged in deep contradictions to the
                        extent of hostility. They differed even measures to deal with the Vietnam
                        issue. China asserted to fight only, not to talks. On the contrary, the
                        Soviet Union maintained to talk, not to fight. In such a situation, the
                        Politburo of the Vietnam Workers’ Party held various meetings and had
                        lengthy and thorough discussions on the U.S.-China relations and came to
                        unanimous agreement that Vietnam should handle, in the best manner, the
                        relations between Vietnam and these two countries, chiefly with China. And
                        Vietnam should seek common voice to forge socialist solidarity in the
                        position to imperialism, not to fall into the adversary’s trap to divide the
                        socialist camp, to keep balanced relations with both countries, and to
                        firmly keep independent and self-reliant policy.</p>
                    <p>Also in those years, there exists that fear psychology of the United States
                        popular opinion prevailing in the world was a threat of war, and wanted to
                        solve the Vietnam issue by peaceful means. Many people in the world,
                        irrespective [of] their tendencies, had very high evaluation of the American
                        strength, the American and the Saigon administrations’ military might in the
                        south. Vice versa, they had low assessment on the struggle of the Vietnamese
                        people, if not too low. The U.S. peace campaign caused difficulties for
                        Vietnam diplomatic struggle, since the United States was able to make many
                        countries, including a number of socialist countries, to have vague and
                        elusive perception on the U.S. policy.</p>
                    <p>Okay. Time finished. May I just have two minutes?</p>
                    <p>The military fund, the political fund, and diplomatic fund have intertwined
                        relationship. They could not be separated. In the war, military victory was
                        decisive, yet the diplomatic struggle brought into active and full play the
                        military victory, and in turn, to contribute to military and political
                        triumph. In the theater, the army were a master of their strategy. It was
                        the same with the political front. The diplomatic front had to be active in
                        offensive position, drove the adversary into passive position.</p>
                    <p>May I conclude my paper by saying that the Vietnam War became the past
                        forever. The history of Vietnam and U.S. relations turned to a new page.
                        Recently in Hanoi, a seminar on Vietnam-U.S. relations was held to mark the
                        15th anniversary of U.S.-Vietnam relations. The participants – both sides
                        expressed their firm confidence that Vietnam and the United States will not
                        let such episodes happen. The new page of the bilateral relationship is and
                        will be the page of friendship and cooperation with common endeavors to work
                        for a peaceful world where everyone is entitled to live and to pursuit of
                        happiness.</p>
                    <p>Last, but not least, I wish to mention one thing that those – the close
                        associates of President Ho Chi Minh told that in his lifetime, from the very
                        beginning to the end, President Ho Chi Minh never wanted war. In the past
                        war of resistance against French globalism, President Ho Chi Minh’s only
                        wish was to have peace with friends. That was why there was shortly latent
                        with friends. For the United States, it was the same. President Ho Chi Minh
                        wanted to win over support from the United States, but he failed, so he had
                        to resist.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your attention. Sorry, thank you. (Applause.)</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">COLONEL HA:</hi> (via interpreter) Mr. Chairman, I thank
                        you for your nice words about my bio. I also want to apologize on my
                        English. I have tried to prepare a piece of paper – my paper in English, but
                        it would take me a long time to read, so I would like to simply say a few
                        words in Vietnamese, so it will be faster.</p>
                    <p>We are very pleased and touched by – that we got invited by the Office of
                        History and the visit that were organized by the Marine Center. And I would
                        like to thank you, the Office of the Historian, and I have just a symbolic
                        (inaudible) to this historian. And this is a very – it’s the decree to
                        change the capital of Vietnam, that we will celebrate 1,000 year of the
                        capital Thang Long, that we would celebrate for 10 days the 1,000-year
                        history of Hanoi that was (inaudible). And I would like to present it to Mr.
                        – the Historian.</p>
                    <p>Thank you. This is the decree ordering the change in the capital in English,
                        in Vietnamese, and in Chinese. And it’s one meter long, symbolizing 1,000
                        years of history of Vietnam. (Applause.)</p>
                    <p>(Pause.)</p>
                    <p>My paper today has this title that we need to assess the adversary in order
                        to win the war, gain victory. We’re not talking about the actual battle
                        between the two countries, but I only want to talk about the Vietnamese
                        side, the observation by the Vietnamese, and in assessing the adversary,
                        this – in order to gain victory, because if it – we compare between the two
                        forces, we are the weaker side, and we needed to know our adversary and
                        assess it in order to gain the victory. Our own population has been that we
                        have – had set a history since the 3rd century. We have had 17 wars against
                        foreign forces, and we have won 14 – 14 victories out of the 17. And we
                        concluded that one of the reason that we got the victory was that we needed
                        to know our adversary. That’s why we – my discussion has to do that we know
                        the adversary.</p>
                    <p>And I would like to make into three area. From 1945 to 1954 is the first
                        period that we’ve had some good relationship between the U.S. and Vietnam
                        before our revolution in August. However, after we gained the control, our
                        Chairman Ho Chi Minh had a lot of good feelings with Mr. Truman and – but
                        we’ve – he send communication, have not received a response from Truman. And
                        yesterday, I had an offer – I had an opportunity to visit the archives, and
                        we got a copy of Ho Chi Minh’s letter to President Truman, and this is the
                        Vietnam – Vietnam would like to have that document. And it’s proof that we
                        really wanted to have good relationship with the United States. And because
                        the U.S. has some other reasons not to have their rapprochement at the time,
                        and this is why we – the U.S. given the signal for France to come back to
                        Vietnam after the Second World War, and that’s why we are fighting the
                        French and before 1954.</p>
                    <p>And what – U.S. have paid 73 percent of the cost of the war for France and
                        the Indochina war. France had to sign the Geneva agreement and the United
                        States did not – were not a signatory, is because the U.S. wanted to be
                        changing – be replacing the French and brought President Ngo Dinh Diem. And
                        also, instead of having election after two years, but with President Diem –
                        Ngo Dinh Diem had refused to participate in the general election because we
                        knew – they knew that if there was an election, Ho Chi Minh would have been
                        the winner in – because that why we have fought against the intervention by
                        the U.S.</p>
                    <p>Our Chairman Ho Chi Minh also recognized that winning over the French is only
                        one small step and that we need to keep fighting and fight the U.S. because
                        we knew what the intent of the U.S. at the time, and we felt that it’s
                        important, and we read the U.S. intention way early. And that’s why we have
                        a new way to reply.</p>
                    <p>Later, when the U.S. keep getting involved into Vietnam and with the
                        so-called Special War, and so the Chairman Ho Chi Minh predict a new, more –
                        from the – early on, the intent of the U.S. For instance, the whole incident
                        of the Gulf of Tonkin is just an excuse to get Vietnam. And we all
                        understood that whole – the intent of the U.S. Once when the U.S. wanted to
                        bring more military forces into Vietnam and we felt that even if they
                        brought in 200,000, 300,000, 400,000, we still have to maintain the same
                        policy because the U.S. wanted to save the social – Special War, because
                        even though the U.S. had brought in a lot of forces, they still have to have
                        the pressure of the public opinion in their country. For instance, why
                        coming over here on this long trip, about 16,000 kilometers from Vietnam
                        here.</p>
                    <p>I then realized the involvement 40 years ago, how it was such a big, large
                        endeavor to bring those troops to Vietnam and all the forces. And we
                        recognized that – and we understand what a commitment the U.S. had at that
                        time. And therefore, we felt that the parties member as well as the military
                        leadership wanted to fight the – in May of 1965, only two months after the –
                        to – command of Vietnam went to Da Nang. And in 1965, we also fight in Van
                        Tuong, which is near Laos. We were surrounded by us – by the U.S., but we
                        were able to come out of the battle even though we also caused large damages
                        to the U.S. Then the third one is (inaudible). In November in 1965, we also
                        had a battle that lasted 100 days. And we felt that after those three
                        battles that we were able to fight and come to victory, even though how – no
                        matter how many troops the U.S. would introduce. And (inaudible) in 1965 and
                        ’66 and ’67, in the dry season, the U.S. had advanced their forces, but we –
                        they were still in the defensive position. And that’s why we started the Tet
                        Offensive, so the U.S. would understand that they could not win in using the
                        armed forces.</p>
                    <p>And so, in summary, I would like to tell you that my whole purpose of this is
                        to see that the determination and the capacity of the party is to know the
                        intent and the action step by step by the U.S. and (inaudible) and in order
                        to stop what – the efforts. And we found that with our own forces, we
                        wouldn’t be able to fight well against the U.S. But after the Tet Offensive,
                        President Johnson had to determine to stop – reduce the bombing in the North
                        and to gradual withdrawal to – from the – troops from Vietnam. And to quote
                        the – one of the Chinese, if they say that – we say that if you know the
                        enemy, then fight, you can win 100 fights, you will win a hundred
                        fights.</p>
                    <p>And therefore, we do know that our history has demonstrated this. This is
                        also a lesson for – not because of Vietnam but for – it’s a lesson for other
                        issue – other situation as well. Once we need to recognize the situation who
                        we opposing in order to either – I agree with Mr. McNamara that one of the
                        reasons that Vietnam – that the U.S. did not win Vietnam is that the U.S.
                        did not understand the determination and did not understand the enemy. The
                        U.S. did not understand the enemy. This is why they did not win.</p>
                    <p>We do not want to point this out to see who is a victor, who’s the – who was
                        defeated. But this is only to say that we will try to use this as a lesson
                        in order to avoid actions that can harm the relationship between the two
                        countries. And I would like to stop here and wish you well. (Applause.)</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROFESSOR NGUYEN: </hi>That’s okay, if you can hear me.
                        Well, I guess since everyone started off talking a bit about where they’re
                        from, their time in Vietnam, I’ll just start that way as well. So I was born
                        in Vietnam. My family, half of which came from the North, left in ‘54 from
                        the North and resettled in the South. And the other half, my mother’s side,
                        many joined the resistance. I left in ’75. You’ll ask, how old was I? I was
                        only five months, so in fact, I didn’t leave but my family did, and I grew
                        up in the United States. So I feel that, given my personal history, I can
                        speak to all three sides because it’s been reflected in my family and my own
                        personal experience. But with that, I still am very much a student of this
                        war and still have much to learn.</p>
                    <p>Before I begin, and I’ll be very brief, I’d just like to thank John Carland
                        and the Office of the Historian for putting together this great conference,
                        and it’s a great honor to be here.</p>
                    <p>What I would just like to say – I mean, I have a lot of comments, and I had
                        it prepared in a – it’s very lengthy, but I know that we have a lot of
                        questions to ask. And commentators tend to do that. It’s one of these things
                        where you think, of course, they just want to kind of keep it short because
                        they didn’t prepare. But really in this situation, I think, because we have
                        these panelists here, these scholars from Vietnam, it is an occasion that
                        doesn’t happen every day, it doesn’t happen every conference. So we really
                        should take advantage of their presence here. And their papers, which I had
                        the honor to read, answered a lot of the questions that scholars in the West
                        have of that war. And in particular, the questions that both of these papers
                        address is: How and why did the Vietnamese revolutionary leadership win the
                        war? And both of these papers address these two questions. And what I’ll
                        just do really briefly, just so that we can concentrate our questions to
                        Ambassador Tung and to Colonel Ha is first start with, in the order that
                        chronologically what the papers address, not the order in which the papers
                        were presented.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Ha does this great thing. He sets up his paper, as you know in this
                        introduction, which places the second Indochina War, the Vietnamese
                        resistance against the United States, within the longer <hi rend="italic"
                            >duree</hi> of history. And here, he starts out with that the history of
                        Vietnam is really a history of being able to resist foreign aggression, and
                        of the 17 wars that Vietnam fought, that they had only lost three. And of
                        course, the first is the 1,000-year occupation of the Chinese that began in
                        antiquity to 939 AD, and then once again, under the Ming Dynasty, and then,
                        of course, the French colonial occupation. And they were the only three
                        times in which Vietnam had lost a war.</p>
                    <p>And then he goes on to say, but of the 14 times in which the United – Vietnam
                        has won, it’s because the Vietnamese know their enemy. And this is really
                        particularly the case with the anti-U.S. resistance struggle. And this is
                        also in a way that – Colonel Ha is also arguing that the United States
                        didn’t understand its enemy, and that’s why he ended with the quote from
                        McNamara.</p>
                    <p>And what he does is he splits it up into three different periods. And he sees
                        that during the French-Indochina War, the period from ’50 – from ’45 to ’54
                        – the North Vietnamese leadership was able to ascertain that it was really
                        the United States that was behind that war of decolonization, that the
                        United States supported the French. And so, from very early on, the North
                        Vietnamese leadership was able ascertain that in the future, the United
                        States would be the enemy of the Vietnamese Revolution and of the
                        people.</p>
                    <p>The second period, he sees as the 1954 to 1964 – 1955 – 1954 to 1964. But
                        here, he basically quotes never seen before documents, and this is in the
                        edited volume called The Party Documents (inaudible). And this is a very
                        valuable primary source that scholars who understand Vietnamese should
                        really have used and should look at. And here, Colonel Ha sees that
                        Vietnamese leadership was able to see very early on that the strategy of
                        U.S., the Special War and then later on to local war, limited war, was
                        bankrupt; it was going to lose because they couldn’t win the political war.
                        So despite the United States being a militarily and economically stronger
                        nation than North Vietnam and their allies in the South, that they were
                        inevitably going to lose.</p>
                    <p>And the last period he looks at is ’64 to ’68. And here, he looks at certain
                        key battles. And I love one of the quotes he didn’t read. And I think this
                        was from Ho Chi Minh or Le Duan, which was just – and I think this was
                        around the time of spring of ’65, that basically, Ho Chi Minh or Le Duan --
                        and you’ll have to tell me which one – is it said, basically: Just fight.
                        Dare to fight. Resolve to fight. Then you will find out how to fight and
                        eventually how to win. So basically, it was baptism by fire. The Vietnamese
                        revolutionary forces just went kind of head on against the United States.
                        And from that learning experience, they realized how to win the war.</p>
                    <p>And then let me now move briefly just to Ambassador Tung’s paper, which
                        covers a longer timeframe. And here, what he does is he basically sets up
                        this very interesting thing which we really don’t see in the historiography,
                        which is that Vietnam was fighting not just the United States and the RVN
                        but they also had a struggle against their allies, the Soviet Union and
                        China, also within the Communist world, and even the Third World. And here,
                        the question he poses is that – and this was asked of Vietnamese leaders –
                        how will you win? There is no possible way that the Vietnamese could defeat
                        the United States. And so in setting up his paper in this way, he shows that
                        what the Vietnamese – the North Vietnamese leadership with their allies in
                        the South had to do was overcome, basically, world opinion that there was no
                        way to defeat this hegemonic power.</p>
                    <p>And what he does is he addresses the relationship between the military,
                        diplomatic, and political struggles. And what he argues here is that, even
                        within the diplomatic struggle, which was a very important aspect of the
                        North Vietnamese war effort, that it was – there was a consensus within the
                        Vietnamese leadership that there had to be victory on the ground. And then
                        that would then reflect within negotiations, but that basically, the war had
                        to be won on the ground.</p>
                    <p>And I wish that Secretary Kissinger were here because he also has this great
                        piece in his paper in which he says, why was it that Le Duc Tho was chosen
                        for the job? And especially given the comments earlier today by Secretary
                        Kissinger, this would answer his question and also help him understand why
                        it was that Le Duc Tho was able to defeat him in Paris and why he had aged
                        so greatly.</p>
                    <p>But let me just read a segment of this paper in which he discusses Le Duc
                        Tho. “Le Duc Tho was converged” – oh, and by the way, he was recalled by Ho
                        Chi Minh, so Ho Chi Minh was the one who chose him for this task for Paris –
                        “Mr. Tho was converged with necessary characters of a negotiator: hard and
                        soft, firm and yielding, highly disciplined. He had admirable revolutionary
                        background that had been tested through and through. Whatever tasks had been
                        assigned to him, he had always done successfully.” There was no way
                        Kissinger was going to win that fight. (Laughter.) So really, that’s the
                        basic bare-bones summary of their talks.</p>
                    <p>I only have a few questions. The first is to Colonel Ha. The picture that you
                        portray is that basically, the North Vietnamese had a firm grasp of the
                        situation in the United States, of the policy in the United States, and the
                        strategy formation and why it was going to be wrong. I just wonder, were
                        there any other – were there dissenters within this group? Were there any
                        military debates that said no, we can’t take this lesson out of Van Tuong or
                        Ia Drang, that in fact, there were too many casualties and that victory
                        wasn’t inevitable? So the first is just what was – were there any debates
                        within the military that were more somber and wasn’t just we were definitely
                        going to win; we only had to fight and keep fighting and learn? Were there
                        any voices that said no, we need to negotiate?</p>
                    <p>And this is connected, then, to my question to Ambassador Tung, which is
                        just: Was there a faction within the diplomatic sphere that wanted peace? In
                        your paper, you talk about Johnson’s peace campaign that greatly hurt the
                        DRV and the war effort, and in particular because of East European communist
                        allies and other third parties pressuring North Vietnam to start talks. My
                        question is were there any within Hanoi, within the MOFA, within the
                        Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who also were ready to start talks before
                        1968?</p>
                    <p>And then a question just for both of you, and I think this is an ongoing –
                        especially in the earlier remarks by Kissinger and Negroponte – were there
                        any missed opportunities on the North Vietnamese side, within the Communist
                        leadership? Were there decisions that were made then that when scholars look
                        at now or even officials who are – who have started making comments saying
                        no, we should have done this differently, we could have won the war earlier,
                        we could have settled it in a different way, we could have avoided war with
                        the United States? So just this question of missed opportunities, which is
                        something that scholars of the Vietnam War love to engage in. I wonder if
                        the same debates are going on in Vietnam. And if so, what are these missed
                        opportunities?</p>
                    <p>And the last is the question I know that you both don’t have an answer, but
                        when will the archives be opened? (Laughter.) Because I think that some of
                        these questions could be answered through that. But your papers definitely
                        go a long way in getting us to understand that war and the proper lessons
                        that should be drawn from it. Thank you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SPECTOR:</hi> I’m going to give the participants a
                        brief period to respond to Professor Nguyen’s questions. And then if we have
                        any time, we can open it up for questions from the floor. So beginning with
                        Ambassador Tung.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMB. TUNG:</hi> Well, very interesting question. Because
                        of the time limitations, I will give a very short brief. With the peace
                        campaign, in order to carry out, to intensify the war and also stopping
                        another war to the North Vietnam, President Johnson also work out a very,
                        very long and very thoughtful, very careful peace campaign in order to put
                        pressure on Vietnam. For the United States here, the President sent envoys
                        to more than 40 countries to campaign for his peace plan. And he also got in
                        touch with more than 145 countries, and also he made hundreds of initiatives
                        in order to put pressure on Vietnam to come to the table. And at the same
                        time, he also used different channels to mediate – to get mediators from the
                        socialist countries, namely from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia,
                        (inaudible) and also Bulgaria.</p>
                    <p>And you see during those days these socialist countries visited Vietnam and
                        even the deputy minister for foreign affairs, Poland, came to Vietnam to put
                        pressure on President Ho Chi Minh, and also on Foreign Minister Nguyen Duy
                        Trinh about the U.S. threats, U.S. military might and U.S. A-bombs, et
                        cetera. That is why President Ho Chi Minh got – sat up and he criticized the
                        Polish, the minister for foreign affairs. He said, “Well, comrades, you are
                        wrong” – he got angry and said.</p>
                    <p>So – and at the same time, the United States also mediate, brought mediators
                        from the newly independent countries from Africa and some Asian countries to
                        persuade Vietnam to come to talks and to reach peaceful resolutions to the
                        Vietnam issue. And in this time, we had many difficulties, especially for
                        the diplomatic activities because of the contradictions between the Soviet
                        Union. So we not only have to fight against the Americans but also to
                        persuade our allies from the Soviet Union, from the East European socialist
                        countries, to believe because they did not believe Vietnam could be able to
                        defeat America militarily. That is why one of the very difficult tasks to
                        Vietnam is to persuade these countries to believe that Vietnam could defeat
                        American militarily.</p>
                    <p>And at the same time, they also afraid that the war will be expanded to world
                        war. So we have to, again, to persuade them that we will limit the war
                        within the territory of Vietnam. This is also very difficult task for
                        Vietnam. And by that time, because of the USSR and China and traditions – so
                        in terms of the aid and assistance given by the Soviet Union and the
                        socialist countries via China, again, as far as transportation is concerned,
                        we had some difficulties also. We have to consult with the Soviet Union, we
                        have to consult with China, on how to transport smoothly the aid and
                        assistance, including weapons, to Vietnam. And of course, by that time the
                        railway line of China was very short and limited. That is why they had to
                        transport the aid from the socialist countries via China, and they had to
                        give more money, more hard currency, why they also have difficulties. These
                        – one of the diplomatic activities that we had and we also resist the
                        pressure from different quarters also.</p>
                    <p>Thank you. I don't know whether I can answer fully questions. That’s it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">COL. HA:</hi> I would like to add on these question – to
                        the question, how did we understand the U.S. that well? We wanted to say
                        that in 1919, when Chairman Ho was very young – he was only 29 – he came to
                        Boston, Massachusetts, and he went to France. He live in France for a long
                        time. And he live in these two countries and understand the thinking of and
                        action of the U.S. and the French. With regard to the war, even in 1945,
                        Chairman Ho had worked with the OSS Office and also to fight against the
                        Japanese and he knew – he understood the Americans, and we – it was – the
                        U.S. was openly helping the French and we – the Chairman know that the U.S.
                        will replace the French in Vietnam, and that was also another thinking that
                        the President Eisenhower thought that there was a domino theory, which is
                        really – didn’t work – didn’t turn out to be true, and that the U.S. also
                        recognized the domino theory as – they really – the U.S. wanted to get
                        involved in Vietnam in order to stop the domino effects.</p>
                    <p>And Mr. Holbrooke this morning – Ambassador Holbrooke said that it was the
                        domino theory only applied to Indochina, to Cambodia and Laos only. So one
                        by one, we tried to assess the view of the French and the U.S. And we also
                        understand that U.S. – that so many of our allies, including China, advised
                        us not to fight. But our party leadership wanted to keep fighting and that
                        we would need to find a way to fight. If we didn’t fight, we would never –
                        perhaps and we might lose at the beginning, but eventually we’ll find a way
                        to fight them. That was the – what the idea that we were following in order
                        to keep following, that we said the (inaudible), the three battles that I
                        referred to this morning, that we fought the U.S. Army, and that’s how we –
                        step-by-step, we did it.</p>
                    <p>And I would like very much take your questions and have exchanges with
                        you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SPECTOR:</hi> And – yes, sir?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Do you have a microphone?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SPECTOR:</hi> I don't know. I think we do. I think I
                        see the microphone approaching.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Back again. Thanks to all three of you for
                        your excellent talks. Four speakers earlier today all commented on the
                        relationship that Vietnam and the U.S. have formed, despite this terrible
                        history. And my question is, in view of all the death and the destruction,
                        the casualties, how were you able to do this? What is it about the
                        Vietnamese people, the Vietnamese culture, perhaps the Buddhist religion?
                        What is it in your nature that enabled your people to be so gracious, to be
                        so welcoming? I not only heard it from the speakers this morning but from
                        friends of mine that have been to Vietnam, ex-soldiers, ex-veterans, who
                        have been there and amazed by the way they were welcomed and received. And
                        remember, I’m from the State of Georgia. Our civil war was 145 years ago,
                        and hell no, it ain’t over. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMB. TUNG:</hi> Well, answer your question – may I put
                        this? I want to come to the tradition of the Vietnamese nation, of the
                        Vietnamese culture. Our people are very peace-loving people, and our
                        tradition is patriotism and also tolerance and friendship with all nations.
                        That is why – but our tradition also teaches us that we have to maintain our
                        independence and self-reliance. And in order to preserve these precious
                        values, we have to show the – our opponent that on the one hand, we have to
                        defend our territory; on the other hand, we have to show our friendship and
                        peace with our – with people outside our territory. That is why.</p>
                    <p>You see, during the war against our northern invaders in the feudalist
                        country, when we defeated them, once we have to – you see to make a statue
                        of those enemies that we killed, and we send these statues to the respective
                        countries. And we also put red carpet and send food along together with them
                        to – when they were defeated. We give them food and everything necessary for
                        them to leave the country. That is – we would like to come to our tradition.
                        The tradition is important and the culture is the national base of the
                        strength of a nation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SPECTOR:</hi> Yes?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> If either of the Vietnamese – would ask if
                        the leadership in the military, the government, made any mistakes over the
                        course of the war?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">COL. HA:</hi> (via interpreter) Your question is a
                        question that we’re studying right now. In the past, our leadership
                        (inaudible) on carrying out the war there, so mistakes made by our own
                        leadership. For instance, the Mau Than, the Tet Offensive of 1968, we felt
                        like we – the victory was about the strategic and political. But the first
                        time – but when we keep continuing that, the offensive, and then we lost a
                        lot and from the General Giap to Chairman Le Duan we all study this whole
                        series of battle, and we need to – we then realized that after 1968 Tet
                        Offensive, and we had a lot of difficulties after the Tet Offensive. We went
                        through three years of difficulties because the Southern National Liberation
                        Front needed to move to Cambodia. And then in 1972 we returned to Vietnam in
                        order to solidify our position. And that was one of the lesson, one of the
                        issue that our leadership felt that we made mistakes when we keep pushing in
                        1968. And we do recognize this is very open. In 19 – we had lost seven –
                        11,000, meaning actually 110,000.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMB. TUNG:</hi> May I add one thing. With regard to this –
                        the Politburo worked out a plan. I think, strategically, it was quite
                        correct. But the measures to be taken later, when we engaged in direct
                        combat, that was because of the – too eager to win the decisive victory and
                        too much ambitions that we conceived. That is why the measures to be taken
                        was not proper to the real process of the national liberation process and
                        also of the political and armed forces. But strategically, it was quite
                        correct because in a war of resistance, we have two – three turning points.
                        The uprising in 1960, what we call – Vietnamese, we call (in Vietnamese) the
                        uprising – this is a very strategic victory. And the second one is Tet Mau
                        Than. And the third one, the final one, was the Ho Chi Minh campaign in
                        1975. So during the war of resistance, we had three very correct strategic
                        turning points. But with Tet Mau Than, because we were too eager to win
                        decisive military victory while our process had not prepared to gain final
                        victory yet. That’s it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SPECTOR:</hi> Yes, sir? Mr. Kalb.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Ambassador, you mentioned a couple times
                        the concern that you had about the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons
                        (inaudible) and repeated it again. And I’m wondering what that
                        (inaudible).</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SPECTOR:</hi> Did everybody hear the question?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> No.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SPECTOR: </hi>Okay. The question was the ambassador
                        mentioned on several occasions the Vietnamese concern about the possible use
                        of tactical nuclear weapons. And Mr. Kalb’s question was: What was the basis
                        for this apprehension about nuclear weapons?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMB. TUNG:</hi> Well, you see, the United States presently
                        asked a number of countries to put pressure on Vietnam. And these countries,
                        even the leader, some leader of these countries ask – threaten us that the
                        U.S have A-bombs; be careful. If you are too aggressive, that they might use
                        that. That is the threat --</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Did you take that seriously?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMB. TUNG:</hi> Pardon?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Did you take that seriously?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMB. TUNG:</hi> We did not take it seriously because we
                        were against the pressure. We did not – we were not pressurized. That is
                        why. We said that while the United States was a superpower, was the
                        mightiest country, but they also have some difficulties, and they [were]
                        limited. That is why. The diplomatic assess is that the U.S., because of
                        their strategies in Europe, in – with their relations with their allies, and
                        their process was threatening mutiny in all of the world, so their process
                        was very (inaudible). And they could not use all mighty – might, military
                        might to defeat Vietnam. That was our assessment.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SPECTOR:</hi> Well, I’d like to thank the panelists
                        and the audience for a very interesting session. And we will now have a
                        break, have a short break. (Applause.)</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">DR. CARLAND:</hi> Okay, we are about to start once again.
                        When I was growing up I was taught that to make it in life you had to have
                        at least two things, you had to have focus and you had to have situational
                        awareness. Earlier, when I was given that very nice gift for the Historian’s
                        Office, I showed – I thought great focus, but I had lost my situational
                        awareness and someone had to bump me so I would come up and accept it. So
                        remember two things: Focus and situational awareness. It will take you a
                        long way.</p>
                    <p>We’re about to have our senior scholars program. We’ve got a distinguished
                        group for you. I’m going to introduce the chair and give it over to him. The
                        chair is Thomas Schwartz. Tom Schwartz is a professor of history at
                        Vanderbilt University and he is the author of, among other things, <hi
                            rend="italic">Lyndon Johnson in Europe: In the Shadow of Vietnam</hi>.
                        He has received fellowships from a variety of distinguished institutions,
                        among them the German Historical Institute, the Norwegian Nobel Institute,
                        the Woodrow Wilson Center, and the Social Science Research Center.</p>
                    <p>We also should point out his service on the Historical Advisory Committee at
                        the Department of State. Certainly, in my years here, Tom was one of the
                        most distinguished and most helpful, and we are grateful for that. He’s also
                        a former president of the Society of Historians of American Foreign
                        Relations. Currently, he’s working on a biography of one our morning
                        presenters, Henry Kissinger, called <hi rend="italic">Henry Kissinger and
                            the Dilemmas of American Power</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Tom, we’ll let you talk about power again here.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SCHWARTZ:</hi> Thank you. Just on a personal level,
                        I am absolutely delighted to be back here at the Department of State. I have
                        served a two-year exile and feel very, very strongly that one of the things
                        that I enjoyed about my service on the Historical Advisory Committee was the
                        extraordinary dedication efforts and work of the Office of the Historian and
                        the young historians I met who were trying to make a record of American
                        foreign policy available to citizens around the world. And that was
                        something I absolutely delighted in and was sorry that I lost the chance to
                        be around for a while.</p>
                    <p>The end of 2008, I would tell my Vanderbilt students there had been three
                        things in my lifetime that I hadn’t expected ever to see. One was an
                        economic crisis like 1929; the second was an African American-elected
                        President of the United States; and the third was Vanderbilt winning a
                        football bowl game. (Laughter.) All three of them, of course, happened at
                        the end of 2008. But there’s a fourth thing now and that was Henry Kissinger
                        sitting in front of a flag of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the
                        United States. (Laughter.) I didn’t expect that either and all that. So,
                        anyway, things do change.</p>
                    <p>We have a great panel here. I’ve asked the speakers to try to limit their
                        remarks to 15 minutes. All of them have an awful lot to say and they really
                        are among the top Vietnam scholars. They’re also – I know a number of very
                        distinguished scholars of Vietnam out in the audience, too, so I really do
                        hope that we’ll have time for a good deal of discussion and questions.
                        There’s a lot to react to, and I hope that the speakers will do so.</p>
                    <p>So I’m going to introduce them – I’ll introduce one by one, though, I think
                        to give a break, in a sense. The first speaker will be David Elliott, who is
                        the H. Russell Smith Professor of International Relations and the Professor
                        of Politics at Pomona College in California. He has a B.A. from Yale
                        University, a PhD from Cornell University. Those of us who teach the Vietnam
                        War know him, though, as the author of the <hi rend="italic">Vietnam War
                            Revolution and Social Change in the Mekong Delta</hi>, a book that we
                        usually can’t fully assign to our students unless we want them to hate us,
                        since it does run into the thousands of pages, but which we do use, as I do,
                        in selected segments, but I’ve also read myself and found absolutely
                        fascinating. David is one of the, I think, premier scholars in studying the
                        Vietnam War, and he will present to us today.</p>
                    <p>Thank you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. ELLIOTT:</hi> Thank you, Tom. And thanks to John
                        Carland for organizing this quite remarkable occasion. I’m sure that all of
                        us who have followed, and certainly those of us who have lived out of
                        Vietnam, found this an extraordinary event.</p>
                    <p>I’d like to talk very briefly about lessons of Vietnam, the inevitable
                        question here. We are supposedly senior scholars on this subject, and I
                        assume that John Carland, in designating senior scholars, wanted us to kind
                        of distill a lifetime of experience or encounter with Vietnam in 10 minutes
                        in the form of some kind of recapitulation of what it all adds up to.</p>
                    <p>I want to talk a little bit about lessons about lessons. One of my former
                        students, Yuen Foong Khong, went on to a remarkable academic career at
                        Harvard and Oxford and wrote a book called <hi rend="italic">Analogies at
                            War</hi>, which many of you are probably familiar with, talking about
                        how and why it’s inevitable that foreign policymakers rely on analogies and
                        historical lessons in decision making. It reduces complexity to
                        understandable or, at least, manageable, proportions and it provides a kind
                        of analytic tool to sort your way through new and unfamiliar territory. But
                        there are perils in selecting analogies, there are perils of misapplication,
                        of selective application, of not understanding correctly the context.</p>
                    <p>But one of the major points that I’d like to make is that I’ve seen a variant
                        of applying the lessons of history that is not something that is learning
                        from history in the sense that Yuen Foong Khong and others have referred to
                        it and learning from the French experience in Indochina and learning from
                        the Vietnam experience in Indochina. But I would call it rather the Grab Bag
                        School of learning from history, and we see it in Afghanistan now. And there
                        I’ve breeched a line here in moving from Vietnam into contemporary
                        events.</p>
                    <p>But in particular, when discussing counterinsurgency strategy, we now see
                        discussions about counterinsurgency strategy, which borrow from a mélange of
                        historical experiences going back to French colonial occupation of Algeria,
                        moving up through the Vietnam War and other experiences, totally
                        decontextualizing the larger framework within which – from which these
                        particular lessons are drawn – lessons about winning hearts and minds. We
                        range now from a discussion of oil spots – this may be familiar to you – to
                        winning hearts and minds, a little from the Algerian War, a little from the
                        Indochina War, a little from the Vietnam War. And one of the things that I
                        think we have learned from Vietnam is that the larger context does matter,
                        that you can’t treat historical lessons as something that can be
                        disassembled and applied in part to meet the needs of the particular moment.
                        The experience has to be understood in its totality.</p>
                    <p>Why has it been so difficult to understand the lessons of Vietnam? Well, of
                        course, the obvious point is there are many lessons of Vietnam, most of them
                        mutually incompatible. But I think Craig Whitney of <hi rend="italic">The
                            New York Times</hi> said it best back in 2004 when analogies were flying
                        to explain what the United States should do in Iraq and how it should
                        proceed in counterinsurgency.</p>
                    <p>As Craig Whitney said at the time that the problem of learning lessons from
                        Vietnam’s fall, it’s clear that the communists won the war in Vietnam. The
                        battle at home has never been concluded. And we heard a little bit of that
                        this morning, a quite different take on Vietnam from Ambassador Holbrooke
                        than that of Secretary Kissinger.</p>
                    <p>There are some specific lessons which we should learn, and that is <hi
                            rend="italic">don’t fabricate history</hi>. Starting in the late 1990s,
                        a new school of revisionists appeared who claimed that the United States
                        had, in effect, won the Vietnam War. Maybe we have. We heard that the
                        Vietnam we now face is the Vietnam we always wanted. So in that sense, I
                        guess we have. But many people felt that too late in the game a proper
                        strategy was found: Clear and hold; the proper general to implement this
                        strategy, General Abrams, came on the scene. And it was only a kind of
                        accident of history that he came along when the American public got tired of
                        the affair and pulled the plug, as Henry Kissinger emphasizes, that really
                        we had the war won if only.</p>
                    <p>My specific take – I want to get down to some nitty-gritty about – that comes
                        out of the 1,500 pages of my book on the Vietnam War and the Mekong Delta,
                        is that by 1971 many people had concluded that the war was over. The Mekong
                        Delta was totally pacified and it was just a matter of time before the
                        United States could get out and turn over our responsibility to the South
                        Vietnamese Government and exit having achieved the gains that Secretary
                        Kissinger pointed out.</p>
                    <p>Those of you who are brave enough to read even the concise version of my
                        book, which is a third as long, will note that I argue there that
                        pacification was not a success. It was a – it had a temporary impact that
                        was certainly quite remarkable. I remember coming back in 1971 to Vietnam,
                        having been away for a couple of years, and being able to drive almost any
                        place I wanted to go in the Mekong Delta, which was inconceivable when I
                        left in 1968. But it was a pacification based on depopulation of the
                        countryside, and I won’t go into any details. And that was the essence of
                        what is now billed as a winning strategy, or what was in Iraq billed as a
                        winning strategy of clear, hold, and build, based on a fundamental
                        misunderstanding of the actual historical truth of Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Why is it so difficult for counterinsurgency to work anywhere, regardless of
                        whether it’s the United States or some other power trying to impose its
                        will? Well, one of the lessons of all insurgencies is that the
                        counterinsurgent doesn’t live there. And to me this is a simple, but
                        absolutely fundamental fact. The asymmetry of commitment and local knowledge
                        in the end is decisive.</p>
                    <p>I was very interested to hear Secretary Kissinger this morning saying that
                        stalemate is not a strategy. But as Ambassador Holbrooke pointed out,
                        stalemate is the best the United States could have aspired to under the
                        conditions of Vietnam. And it would have required maintaining a substantial
                        number of American troops for an infinite duration, something which is
                        politically and economically infeasible. And indeed it was Secretary
                        Kissinger who in his famous <hi rend="italic">Foreign Affairs</hi> article
                        of ’68 says the guerilla wins if he doesn’t lose.</p>
                    <p>I guess the final point is that it’s difficult, as Richard Cohen of <hi
                            rend="italic">The Washington Post</hi> said at the time of the
                        discussions about Iraq some years ago, it’s difficult to recover from the
                        time the first fundamental mistake is made. This is another key fact that we
                        should have learned from Vietnam. And I refer to a comment, which may have
                        passed some of you by, of Colonel Nguyen Manh Ha, who said that the United
                        States intervened in Vietnam in a position of strategic passivity. This
                        means that no strategy that the United States could devise had a chance of
                        success. This is essentially what Secretary Kissinger admitted finally this
                        morning, and Ambassador Holbrooke even more forcefully pointed this out. And
                        if that’s the case, what are the implications for Afghanistan or even Iraq?
                        Is it possible, indeed having made a strategic blunder in the initial
                        intervention, to recover? I think the lessons of Vietnam on this score are
                        not reassuring.</p>
                    <p>The final point I want to make is to bring to your attention, those of you
                        who may have forgotten and those of you may have never known it, the only
                        law of social science that I have ever found to be unchallengeable, and
                        that’s the Ellsberg Law – the very same Daniel Ellsberg who leaked the
                        Pentagon Papers. He, unlike Secretary Kissinger and Ambassador Holbrooke,
                        who emphasize that the United States kind of unwittingly got sucked into a
                        quagmire, said that the historical record – and I think the first volumes
                        really, really prove this – that every president from Kennedy through Nixon
                        knew that the actions that they were taking in Vietnam wouldn’t work in the
                        long run – and this is particularly true of Kennedy and Johnson – knew that
                        they might even make the situation worse or even irretrievable in the long
                        run, but still did it.</p>
                    <p>Think of Bob Woodward’s book , just emerged, which I’ve only read <hi
                            rend="italic">The Washington Post</hi> summaries of it, but explaining
                        why a beleaguered President Obama has been sort of pushed into a corner in
                        making decisions about Afghanistan which he clearly doesn’t believe in, and
                        implementing a strategy which he doesn’t, obviously, believe is going to
                        work.</p>
                    <p>Well, the Ellsberg law has an answer for this. Why would presidents behave in
                        such an apparently irrational manner? And the answer, to be brief, is the
                        presidential electoral cycle. First-term presidents, said Ellsberg, do the
                        minimum necessary to forestall disaster until reelected for a second term.
                        And if that means throwing in more chips in a losing venture just to keep
                        the pot simmering and not boiling over, so be it.</p>
                    <p>So a few lessons from history and also an invitation for you to go back to
                        the wonderful State Department historical record of the Vietnam War for some
                        illustrations and examples. (Applause.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SCHWARTZ:</hi> Actually, David, though I was
                        thinking – just refused to think about the presidential cycle doesn’t work
                        sometimes. Maybe it doesn’t work with Republicans, but George Bush upped the
                        ante in Iraq after that. Yeah, so it doesn’t always happen that way.</p>
                    <p>But anyway, our next speaker will be George Herring. Anyone who’s ever
                        talked, of course, on the Vietnam War knows George’s work, <hi rend="italic"
                            >America’s Longest War</hi>. It’s a phenomenal book. My students have
                        always loved it. It captures the war. It is so well written, presented. And
                        George, of course, now is professor emeritus at the University of Kentucky,
                        served as chair of the department, was a Fulbright scholar, all sorts of
                        honors, and recently finished a book, <hi rend="italic">From Colony to
                            Superpower: American Foreign Relations Since 1776</hi>, showing a range
                        of his own knowledge of this period. But certainly for many of us, George
                        has always been the dean of American historians of Vietnam. And we look
                        forward to his presentation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. HERRING:</hi> Thanks, Tom, for that very nice
                        introduction. And thanks to the historical office and John for putting this
                        conference together.</p>
                    <p>I, too, was a member of the panel, Historical Advisory Committee, in the
                        ’90s. It was a great pleasure to meet the people working on the <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes, which I’ve relied on since
                        the day I started serious research in the field, a date I will not mention.
                        (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>In listening to David talk, I was reminded of Jim Thompson’s hyperbolic
                        statement about lessons. I think he made it in 1968, if I’m right, before
                        the war was even over, but by which time lessons were already being talked
                        about. Never again take on the job of trying to defeat a nationalist
                        anti-colonialist movement under indigenous communist control in former
                        French Indochina – (laughter) – a lesson, he added, of less than universal
                        relevance. Now that’s much too exclusionary, I think, but it’s something I
                        frequently use.</p>
                    <p>I’m delighted to be a member of this panel, even though it’s called a Senior
                        Scholars’ Panel, which bears the dubious, but in my case well-earned
                        distinction, of senior scholar. In setting up the panel, John instructed us
                        to talk about what we think about what we know about the Vietnam War. In
                        point of fact, I’ve been away from research on the war for the last 10 years
                        and I think in my case I might better talk about what I know that I don’t
                        know about the war. More on that later.</p>
                    <p>I didn’t serve in Vietnam. I was one of that lucky generation that was too
                        young for Korea and too old for Vietnam. I got out of the Navy in 1960. My
                        early education on the war took place in college campuses. I began teaching
                        – the date is significant – August, 1965, shortly after Johnson’s
                        summer-fall escalation. I had been trained in what we then called, without
                        apology, American diplomatic history – the field has broadened since then –
                        with a sub-field in South Asia, several courses in Chinese history, but I
                        can only be honest in saying that when I started teaching, I knew absolutely
                        nothing about the war going on in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>But because that war was so central to everything that happened on university
                        campuses for the next 10 years, I tried to educate myself. Some of my
                        education came at the hands of students and papers they did, for which I’ve
                        always been very grateful. Once I learned something about the war, how it
                        had begun, its history, I could never quite look at it the same way I had
                        before. In time, although I was bothered somewhat – more than somewhat, I
                        guess – by the rhetoric of the antiwar movement, I became what I myself
                        called a flaming centrist, and after 1968 at the University of Kentucky did
                        take part in protest.</p>
                    <p>I also became, and I may have gotten more of a feel for the war this way than
                        any other way, a sort of unofficial counselor, or maybe better put listener,
                        to veterans back from the war who sensed that I was sympathetic and
                        interested, and talked, and talked quite candidly, always behind closed
                        doors.</p>
                    <p>In 1975, partly to satisfy a curiosity that became keener with everything I
                        read and learned, I wrote a little pamphlet on the Vietnam War. I think it
                        may still be in print; I hope not. I shudder to think what I might have said
                        at that tender age in that tender point. But it convinced me to write a
                        book, and that’s what I did between 1975 and 1979. In those years, even, I
                        was very excited to find a great deal of material unearthing itself in U.S.
                        archives. It enabled me to dispel a myth here and there and to write a
                        history that was reasonably well-rounded in original sources.</p>
                    <p>When I look back on it, I feel fortunate to have done the book when I did. I
                        can’t imagine trying to do it now, as John Prados just recently did, with
                        the huge amount of material available, all those <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> volumes. I bet if you stacked them end on end, they’d be
                        taller than I am. That staggers the imagination. The point is, I guess, that
                        I have been involved with the Vietnam War in one way or the other for almost
                        50 years now. Looking back, several things stand out. The first, David has
                        already alluded to and talked about.</p>
                    <p>Something I did not expect when I published <hi rend="italic">America’s
                            Longest War</hi> in 1979 was the way the Vietnam experience has
                        continued to influence policy debates and decisions, foreign policy
                        decisions. Little need to elaborate here. We referred to it this morning.
                        David talked about it already this afternoon. We remember, many of us
                        remember, the centrality of Vietnam to the debates on possible intervention
                        in Central America in the’80s, the Balkans in the’90s. The first President
                        Bush claimed in March 1991 to have buried the so-called “Vietnam syndrome”
                        in the sands of the Arabian Desert. In fact, we later learned one of the
                        reasons – maybe not the main one, but one of the reasons they didn’t go on
                        to Baghdad for total victory or a larger victory in the war was the fear
                        that they might get bogged down in a Vietnam-like quagmire in Iraq.</p>
                    <p>It has been speculated that one of the reasons that we went to war – that the
                        second President Bush went to war in Iraq in 2003 was to eliminate once and
                        for all, again, those negative memories of Vietnam that allegedly act as a
                        constraint against military intervention abroad. And of course, once the
                        insurgency began in the summer of 2003, I can remember the afternoon when
                        reporters started asking McNamara about the possible quagmire in Iraq –
                        quagmire, of course, being a very clear, scarcely disguised codeword for
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>We’ve talked today already, and we’ll undoubtedly talk more, about the – how
                        the analogy has carried over to Afghanistan. David mentioned the way that
                        the counterinsurgency people in the Army and elsewhere have looked back to
                        General Abrams to find a model for success that indicates that we can fight
                        that kind of war, and even some ideas about how to fight it.</p>
                    <p>Last year about this time, the pages of newspapers were full of op-ed pieces
                        proclaiming various and usually conflicting lessons from Vietnam. And it was
                        said that President Obama had a copy of the aforementioned Gordon
                        Goldstein’s book, <hi rend="italic">Lessons in Disaster</hi>, on his
                        nightstand and it was being looked at by everybody involved in the debate on
                        his decisions. Some may recall that in his West Point speech, December of
                        last year, he made a special point of saying that Vietnam and Afghanistan
                        were different, as a way of saying, “Look, folks, it’s not going to come out
                        the same way it did before.”</p>
                    <p>The second thing that impresses me, looking back on the last 50 years, and
                        excites me, is the veritable flowering of Vietnam War scholarship in the
                        past 10 years. Some of you may remember Bob McMahon’s 1994 essay,
                        historiographical essay, one of the main points of which was that the
                        writing, the war to that time had been American-centered. Americans usually
                        large – using largely American documents, writing about American issues from
                        an American perspective. I suspect that we Americans still dominate in the
                        writing of the war, but the sources and perspectives have broadened
                        considerably. Those who write about the American side now, as I’ve already
                        suggested, have a vast array of documents that were not available when I
                        wrote in the ’70s or even when I did my fourth edition of <hi rend="italic"
                            >American’s Longest War</hi> in 2001. Especially true for the Nixon
                        years, where the White House materials alone, not to mention other
                        materials, are simply overwhelming in their magnitude.</p>
                    <p>Even more important and enlightening, I think, is the broader perspective
                        that is being provided. We have excellent works based on archival evidence
                        documenting the Soviet and Chinese role in the war. The Cold War
                        International History Project has made available literally archives all
                        across the world, documents that shed a great deal of new light on the war.
                        But I think the most exciting thing that’s beginning to happen now is we’re
                        beginning to get excellent coverage of the war from the Vietnamese
                        perspective. Rather important, I think, since after all, it was their war
                        that we chose to inject ourselves into.</p>
                    <p>Americans with Vietnamese language skill are doing exciting work on U.S.
                        interaction with South Vietnam and South Vietnamese in the ’50s and ’60s.
                        Some of this is revisionist in a lot of ways, and it kind of jars the
                        sensibilities of we old-timers who are stuck back in the ’60s and ’70s. We
                        can also hope that this sort of analysis will expand to cover these later
                        years.</p>
                    <p>We’re also beginning to get excellent studies of the enemy. Mark Bradley’s
                        splendid survey of the Vietnamese at war, David’s [Elliott’s] magisterial
                        study of the war in the Delta, my colleague Hang Nguyen’s, path-breaking
                        work on North Vietnamese decision making, reflecting changes – broad changes
                        – in the historical profession, I think. We’re also beginning to branch out
                        into areas we didn’t do before, from pop culture in the United States to
                        village political culture in Vietnam. Given this explosion of recent
                        scholarship should I seek to do a fifth edition, I would have, I think,
                        almost as big a challenge as I did in 1976.</p>
                    <p>A final and, to me, kind of perplexing and interesting point or question: As
                        far as I can tell, the two histories that I have mentioned here, the memory
                        sort of a metaphorical history and the scholarly history rarely, if ever,
                        intersect. Public officials use history in their own way for their own
                        purposes. They remain, for the most part, grandly oblivious to the
                        scholarship being produced in the academy and how it’s reshaping the history
                        of the war, answering with some authority a lot of questions that for years
                        were debatable.</p>
                    <p>Government agencies have a historical office. I know the one here at State
                        the best. The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is
                        magnificently done, an indispensible source. But it’s my impression that
                        in-house historians are not consulted when there’s a big decision underway
                        and historical references are being used, nor are they likely to be in a
                        position to challenge officials who make such statements. Those who are
                        promoting counterinsurgency with such passion and enthusiasm put forth
                        Vietnam as a successful case study, rely, it seems to me, on a history that
                        seems to be quite superficially sourced, and ignore scholarly work such as
                        David has done, detailing what’s actually happening in the countryside in
                        South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Not surprising, I suppose. Policymakers use history intuitively, select
                        references that reinforce their predispositions or suit their purposes du
                        jour. They might not even want to be bothered by history that emphasizes the
                        nuances, the complexity, the ambiguity, the singularity of historical
                        lessons, the perils of using such lessons in the first place.</p>
                    <p>I was thinking last night while having dinner over at the hotel (inaudible),
                        a few final questions that I throw out. Is the gap between academic history
                        and the history resorted to by policymakers bridgeable, or even should it –
                        we make an effort to bridge it? Should we try to make our history more
                        accessible to and usable by policymakers? Are there ways to get them to take
                        our history more seriously? I have no answers to these questions, but it
                        seems entirely appropriate to raise them in this conference room named for
                        that great statesman George C. Marshall, who, as Ernest May observed years
                        ago, read almost no history but had a marvelous sense of the ebb and flow of
                        history and the limits it imposed and that sort of thing. Thank you.

                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SCHWARTZ:</hi> A quick question. George, when you
                        mentioned in summer of 2003 in the quagmire and the questions and you said
                        to McNamara, I was wondering if you were referring to Rumsfeld.</p>
                    <p>

                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. HERRING:</hi> I don’t even remember saying McNamara,

                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SCHWARTZ:</hi> That’s all right. Now, though, I
                        thought – McNamara was still around and he was commenting, but indeed when,
                        in 2003, Rumsfeld was asked – I mean, this was – the quagmire already was
                        coming to play and all that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. HERRING:</hi> It was a Freudian slip, so --</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SCHWARTZ:</hi> It was a good slip, though. Our final
                        senior historian, probably who might reject the idea of being senior – I’m
                        not sure about that, John – but John Prados, who directs the National
                        Security Archives, Iraq documentation project as well as its Vietnam
                        project, the senior research fellow at the National Security Archive. And
                        any of you who are familiar – I’m sure many of you are familiar with the
                        Lord’s work that the National Security Archive does, basically, for us as
                        diplomatic historians, especially with the difficulty of getting materials
                        out. The National Security Archive is an absolutely wonderful organization
                        that has worked diligently to open up archives. And John has been a major
                        part of that.</p>
                    <p>John holds a Ph.D. in international relations from Columbia University. He is
                        an absolutely prolific author and I could spend a little bit of time just
                        running down all these titles, but let me just say the book that – of
                        course, out of which or from which many of us are familiar with him now on
                        Vietnam is his book, <hi rend="italic">Vietnam: The History of an Unwinnable
                            War</hi>. And I think John has been itching since this morning’s talks
                        to have a chance to speak.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. PRADOS:</hi> Thank you very much, Tom, and thank you
                        to the Historian’s Office for hosting this and to the State Department for
                        having such a wonderful thing as the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations in
                            the United States</hi> series. And of course, Tom is right; I am itching
                        to talk, but before I go there, I want to talk a bit about actually the <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.</p>
                    <p>And let me go there this way: Thirty-eight years ago today in a room not far
                        from where we’re sitting here, Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger, and Alexander
                        Haig were sitting down discussing what Mr. – what General Haig would say
                        when he arrived in Saigon for a trip he was about to take out to the Far
                        East to consult with the South Vietnamese Government on the next steps in
                        the drive to secure a ceasefire agreement that would lead to the Paris
                        Accord of January 1973.</p>
                    <p>Now, this was also the process that led to the Christmas bombing of December
                        1972. And for – from a historian’s perspective, the problem of explaining
                        that sequence of events, this search for the agreement, this sudden eruption
                        of violence, this to-ing and fro-ing of negotiations is an important one,
                        and historians – we rely on evidence, all right? It just so happens that the
                        plan for bombing of Hanoi and the Red River Delta by B-52 bombers was
                        assembled by the chairman of the joint staff – or I should say the chief of
                        the joint staff – the joint chiefs of staff on September the 27th, 1972, two
                        days before this talk at the White House.</p>
                    <p>And that day or the next day, Haig’s military assistant, Jonathan Howe, wrote
                        a memorandum of analysis about the implications of this bombing plan. And at
                        this meeting on September 29th, the president and his cohorts discuss where
                        they’re going to go with the negotiation plan and they hint at, but do not
                        directly talk about, the details of this other idea. The plan, however, went
                        to Saigon with Haig in his briefcase and he took it with him to meet with
                        the American Air Force commander there and they discussed whatever they
                        discussed.</p>
                    <p>Fast forward three weeks, late October of 1972, the Vietnamese and – or the
                        North Vietnamese and Mr. Kissinger, in another series of meetings in Paris,
                        had put the finishing touches on what they thought was going to be a
                        ceasefire agreement and a peace. Kissinger was en route to making the “Peace
                        is at Hand” press conference. But the question was would Saigon go along.
                        And Saigon, in fact, rejected any idea of going along with this peace
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>The upshot of it was that on the 22nd of October of 1972, Kissinger sent a
                        cable back to Haig in Washington, saying that there was a moral problem in
                        bombing North Vietnam, which is what he had a plan to do, on the basis of
                        South Vietnam not accepting the peace agreement, okay? It’s kind of a
                        reversal of the situation, but it’s a definite problem of historical
                        interpretation.</p>
                    <p>Now, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is a wonderful,
                        wonderful resource for research, all right? And the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Foreign Relations</hi> series contains the record of the talk that the
                        senior people were having today on the 29th of September. But it doesn’t
                        have either the joint staff plan or the NSC staff evaluation of the plan or
                        the Kissinger cable from Paris that contains this line about the morality of
                        bombing North Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>So a history that’s based on the very real, very accurate documents that are
                        in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series would not have access
                        to that very important material. In other words, it would be an incomplete
                        version or vision of the world. Now, this is a problem in every kind of
                        compilation like this, of which I and some of our other people from the
                        archive who are here are familiar with, and we deal with it all the time,
                        because there’s a question of selection of material.</p>
                    <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series – and I’m probably one
                        of the few people who has read every <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of
                            the United States</hi> volume on Vietnam from 1940 to 1972 – in the <hi
                            rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series, there is a huge array of
                        material, and it’s an incredible resource for historians. But it’s also
                        limited both by what it encompassed at any given moment in time, and also
                        what materials were being produced. As new technology has come in and we’ve
                        produced a wider array of materials, there’s even more of a question of what
                        to be included in the series. And this is a complexity for those who
                        assemble these series and it’s a word of warning for us consumers of these
                        materials, all right?</p>
                    <p>And I just want to say that in the new set of <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> series, which sort of completes the set on Vietnam, for
                        the first time, transcripts are included of tape recordings of
                        conversations, both over the telephone and in person, and that’s a great
                        advance. And there’s a wide array of material from every agency of the
                        government. In 1940, 1945, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                        volumes on Vietnam contained solely diplomatic cables. Now, you can open up
                        a <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volume and read what the NSC was saying to DOD
                        and back again – a major, major advance.</p>
                    <p>All right. However – so with that major advance, we get new insights. For
                        example, in the volume that’s just released, the covers .the Laotian
                        invasion – for the first time, we begin to get a glimpse of the role of some
                        of the other characters in this story. I wanted to just mention Admiral
                        Thomas Moorer, because Moorer was almost never considered in these accounts
                        of the Nixon years. But in fact, in the days going up to the Laotian
                        invasion, Moorer not only assured the president of the United States that
                        Laos was an easy target. He told him that the weather would be good, that
                        there would be little danger to United States helicopters flying missions on
                        this invasion, that the North Vietnamese would have difficulty reacting to
                        the operation, and that – oh, of course, it was our last opportunity to
                        carry out an operation of this type because the withdrawals of American
                        forces under Vietnamization would take away the capacity to engage in that
                        kind of air support. So Moorer had an agenda in mind, and records that you
                        can now see for the first time in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> series will show you, will illustrate in much greater
                        detail the roles of some of these subordinate characters.</p>
                    <p>All right. Let me move on to some of the things that we heard this morning.
                        And probably the most serious one is the question of – that America wanted
                        compromise, but Hanoi insisted on victory. This was – I think he made that
                        remark in a different context at least twice, Dr. Kissinger did, in his
                        accounting of how he proceeded on negotiations. And what he was talking
                        about was the objectives of the two sides. Always, North Vietnam was
                        considered to have an objective that sought a victory; the United States
                        didn’t have an objective, in Kissinger’s view, or else its objective was a
                        compromise end to the war.</p>
                    <p>I want to just quote to you from the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                        series a few things that were said in that White House office across the
                        street over there. All right. Kissinger – I’m sorry – Mr. Nixon tells
                        Admiral Moorer to tell Kissinger on December the 9th, 1970, quote, “He wants
                        you to know he has no intention of losing.”</p>
                    <p>Nixon, with Admiral Moorer and Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird on December
                        23rd, 1970: Our plans should have – quote, “Our plans should have as their
                        objective an enduring Vietnam.” Now, we can argue about the details of U.S.
                        military programs, but the goal of having an enduring Vietnam certainly
                        required a military victory over the other side in the Vietnam War.
                        Okay?</p>
                    <p>In January, 1971, when Laird returns from a trip to Southeast Asia and
                        presents his trip report and there’s conversation about the Nixon Doctrine,
                        you may or may not recall that the Nixon Doctrine was a sort of way of
                        retrenching U.S. foreign policy on a global scale, not just in Vietnam but
                        one in which we were going to emphasize regional powers to take the
                        frontline for us in various specific situations. Nixon says to there that –
                        he included South Vietnam among the list of countries in which the United
                        States should stay, under his Nixon Doctrine, which again presupposes a
                        situation where the United States would go for broke in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>To Kissinger on April the 23rd, 1971: “Despite all the way we put the
                        cosmetics on, Henry, they know goddamn well what our policy is, is to win
                        the war.” Unquote.</p>
                    <p>On May the 22nd, 1972, in the middle of the Easter offensive, Al Haig tells
                        the Washington Special Action Group in Mr. Nixon’s name, quote, “The
                        President’s strategy is to win.”</p>
                    <p>It’s simply not accurate that the United States simply only sought a
                        compromise in the Vietnam conflict. Now, I’d be more comfortable about
                        Kissinger’s ruminations about his past if they weren’t, in fact, problematic
                        on a very damaging kind of a historical level, you know. Not just that
                        they’re presenting his history in the best light but that he is directing us
                        to conclusions and observations that are very different from the way things
                        really played. He said to us at least four different ways this morning that
                        – how was it that he put this – oh, “The real problem is whether we can have
                        a serious debate about policy or whether these debates on policy were going
                        to turn into civil war.” In other words, that the antiwar movement in the
                        United States assumed a moral position, assumed it had a moral superiority
                        over the president and his decision makers, and that that was the basis of
                        the problems in American policymaking during the Nixon Administration.</p>
                    <p>On April 23rd, 1971, Henry Kissinger advised Richard Nixon to go ahead and
                        pump up government action against Americans who dissented from Vietnam
                        policy in the United States. The position that this is a neutral debate
                        about policy in a conflict, in an American conflict, steps completely
                        outside of the extent to which the United States Government during the
                        period of the Vietnam War adopted actual direct tactics of suppression and
                        subversion against American people. And that is a disingenuous element in
                        Kissinger’s entire account of this period, one which I submit as historians
                        we should not accept.</p>
                    <p>All right? I know I’m running close. (Laughter.) Okay. And let me leave you
                        with this one. Oh, no, actually, I can’t leave [Operation] Duck Hook out of
                        here. All right, let me take “decent interval” really quickly. He said that
                        if you looked at the commentaries about the force and escalation options in
                        1969, you would find that the record was entirely composed of statements
                        that the United States made to the other side in the context of trying to
                        get the North Vietnamese to move forward on a negotiation. But in fact, the
                        phrase itself and the whole idea of the decent interval originated in an
                        article that Henry Kissinger wrote in <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Affairs</hi>. Just the idea that we should accept this construction of the
                        situation is mind-boggling to me.</p>
                    <p>And it goes on to the whole Duck Hook situation and the question of whether
                        there was a specific plan to attack North Vietnam, which Henry says – I’m
                        sorry; Dr. Kissinger – that he wrote these memos which he stuck in small
                        print in the back of his memoir just for the purpose of being comprehensive,
                        but that he never followed the memoranda into the Oval Office, nor in fact
                        did he advocate the policies that were in those memoranda. That is a
                        completely misleading construction of the history. In fact, from the first
                        day of the Nixon Administration, the White House and the NSC staff were
                        pressing for more forceful options from the U.S. military commands and from
                        the diplomats as well. And within the week of taking office, Kissinger had
                        Moorer and Secretary Laird in his office, shaking them down for more
                        aggressive options. And the secret bombing of Cambodia simply diverted some
                        of this escalatory initiative away from the idea of striking directly at
                        North Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>But the intention to move against North Vietnam remained and it was embodied
                        in several projects through the spring, summer, and fall of 1969 until you
                        got to the point of President Nixon’s November 3rd speech. And the real
                        question of whether there was a project to attack North Vietnam, to escalate
                        the war, has to be defined in terms of how you approach that speech of
                        November 3rd, 1969, Mr. Nixon’s so-called Silent Majority Speech. We will
                        find someday the true story of the Duck Hook thing in the maneuvering around
                        the beginnings of Vietnamization, the beginnings of negotiation, and the
                        November 3rd speech.</p>
                    <p>Here is a case where, unfortunately, <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of
                            the United States</hi> doesn’t go far enough in terms of laying out the
                        documentary framework that we need. And it’s also one where, as we saw this
                        morning, some of the principals in these activities have a major incentive
                        to present a certain construction of the history. Beware of constructions of
                        history. Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SCHWARTZ:</hi> John never disappoints. He’s laid out
                        an extraordinary record. I confess that he reminded me, as he was going
                        through the lists of things in which Dr. Kissinger may not have been
                        forthright about, he reminded me of a line that one of Kissinger’s
                        associates, Helmut Sonnenfeldt, once said, that Henry doesn’t lie because
                        it’s in his interest; he lies because it’s in his nature. (Laughter.) Which
                        is – it does come from a friend, as I said. But that is probably overly
                        harsh.</p>
                    <p>I have a – I’m going to take the chair’s prerogative to make two points and
                        then turn it over to questions. One thing that’s gone through my mind as
                        we’ve talked about Vietnam is how little we ever talk about the other Asian
                        war America fought in, Korea. And the divided Korea is still perplexing us.
                        And I guess one of the reasons I bring it up, not because I have any
                        affection for the dear leader, is that Korea actually provides a
                        counterpoint. And Korea was in much in people’s minds as any other analogies
                        at the time. And I think it’s very interesting that it hasn’t come up. And
                        in a way, it also reminds me of one conversation I had with a Vietnamese
                        official about eight years ago. When I posed the question of why North
                        Vietnam was determined to launch offensives when it seemed to me from
                        reading the American documents – and here I may take some disagreement with
                        John – but it seemed to me that America wanted an out and was more than
                        willing to have a decent interval, and simply why not wait? South Vietnam
                        would eventually fall. And he said, “We might have ended up like North
                        Korea. We might have ended up sort of in a permanent state of division, and
                        we would have ended up the isolated, poor communist brother of the more
                        prosperous South.”</p>
                    <p>And I throw that out there because, in a way, the alternative ending, the
                        ending of a Korean-type ending was, I think, what American leaders sought in
                        their best possible moments. It wasn’t – maybe it wasn’t possible in
                        Vietnam, but it certainly is worth thinking harder about why the situations
                        are so different.</p>
                    <p>And the second point is something that I felt that Professor Nguyen in her
                        very generous questions to her countrymen’s papers today about whether there
                        are dissent, whether there’s other points of view within the Vietnamese
                        arguments about the war, that – and this is dangerous, I suppose for
                        someone, and a little uncomfortable for an American to present. But it does
                        seem to me that in the situation in which a country goes to war and loses
                        almost three million people, that it is worth asking whether it was worth it
                        on their side as well as on our side, and whether the effort was –
                        especially when the outcome produced a social and economic order that’s not
                        quite what the revolutionaries said they were fighting for. And it’s worth
                        at least raising, I think, that question.</p>
                    <p>But with those points, let me turn it over to questions. We’re going to do
                        questions a little different, which is I’m much more comfortable with. I’m
                        not going to call on people, but the people with the microphones will do the
                        determining by simply presenting these chosen ones with the microphones. So
                        I’m going to ask Chris and –</p>
                    <p>

                        <hi rend="strong">DR. PRADOS:</hi> I don’t mean to say that the United
                        States did by no means seek a compromise ending to the Vietnam War. What I
                        would argue, however, is that the Nixon Administration interpreted the
                        diplomatic – the structure of the diplomatic situation in such a fashion
                        that, like the Vietnamese themselves, our vision of the Vietnamese wanting
                        to negotiate from a position of strength, we wanted to negotiate from a
                        position of strength. And doing that, negotiating from a position of
                        strength, required a degree of military victory.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SCHWARTZ:</hi> Okay. Do you want to start the –</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Thanks to all three of you for sharing your
                        comments on Vietnam. I teach at St. Louis University. I teach a class on the
                        Vietnam War. And I was a medical evacuation helicopter pilot in Vietnam in
                        1971. Question for John: I understand that you have just relatively recently
                        unearthed some documents that would clear up the confusion that at least I
                        have over the culpability of the Kennedy Administration in the overthrow of
                        the Diem regime. Can you share some comments on that?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. PRADOS:</hi> Sure. Actually, at the National Security
                        Archive, we did a project putting together the evidence on the Kennedy
                        years. And in the course of that, we filed FOIA requests for a series of
                        tape recordings, some of the early tape recordings and, again, material that
                        was not available actually at the time that the foreign relations series on
                        this period was done.</p>
                    <p>In any case, after about 10 years, late last year, those tapes were
                        declassified. And they concern a passage about a week in late August of 1963
                        right after the South Vietnamese generals had first approached our own
                        people about and asked [for] an answer to the question of whether the United
                        States would support a coup in South Vietnam if they launched it. And so the
                        tapes concern the Kennedy higher-ups’ conversations about this exact
                        question. And there are meetings about a potential coup, there are briefings
                        – see there’s at least two CIA briefings about what the arrangement of coup
                        forces was, a whole set of material around this.</p>
                    <p>Late last year, we published them, posted them as part of an electronic
                        briefing book at the National Security Archive. If you go to our website,
                        you should be able to find it. And we have actually the audio as well as the
                        memcons for those same meetings. And we show you the difference between the
                        memcon as written by one of the State Department people and the memcon as
                        presented by one of the NSC staff people for the same meeting. There’s a lot
                        of meat in there. You’ll just have to see it. But go there and find it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Yes. Thank you. My name is (inaudible) from
                        Gadjah Mada University, Indonesia. I don’t know to whom this question should
                        go, but perhaps Professor George Herring, as he talks about a more
                        historiographical part of the discussion today. The American enforcement in
                        Vietnam, did it have any relation to a bigger picture of the United States
                        foreign policy in Southeast Asia? I don’t know whether that’s clear. The
                        American involvement in Vietnam, did it have, did it have any, any bigger
                        picture, any relation to a bigger picture of the United States policy in
                        Southeast Asia?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. HERRING:</hi> Of course, I think what you’re
                        referring to, an argument has been made. I heard – I have heard several
                        times Walt Rostow make it with great insistence, that our – the fact that we
                        stayed in Vietnam for as long as we did made it possible for Southeast Asia,
                        the rest of Southeast Asia, to become stabilized as it did. That is
                        certainly an argument that a lot of people believe. But again, we’re looking
                        at the sort of things we can’t really prove. What would have happened if we
                        hadn’t been there? McNamara argued in 1967 – there was a lot of substance
                        here – that Indonesia had already gone the way the United States wanted it
                        to go, and that was a huge step towards stability in Southeast Asia; the
                        best thing would be for us to begin to try to disengage because Southeast
                        Asia was already going in the right direction. So I’m not, I’m not,
                        convinced. I’ve heard the argument a number of times.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Hello. Yes, my question is probably to the
                        whole panel, but I think more specifically to John. Thanks, by the way, for
                        wonderful talks. All three of them were fascinating. I’m afraid is what I’m
                        going to try and prise out of you an answer that deals with Southeast Asia
                        rather than Vietnam, but also draws on Henry Kissinger’s remarks this
                        morning. My research is on the impact of the Cold War on the Thai middle
                        class, by the way.</p>
                    <p>Kissinger made two points which I thought were very interesting. The first
                        thing is, is, well, not to point – the first thing I noticed is he didn’t
                        mention communism in relating – talking about the North Vietnamese. He
                        talked actually about a regime that was – had been fighting for over 50
                        years. So in that sense, he’s talking about a nationalist movement.</p>
                    <p>The second thing he said, which I thought was fascinating, was that – I’m
                        sorry – is he wanted Vietnam to have the chance to develop an independent
                        identity. And I thought that word “develop” was interesting, the suggestion
                        that they hadn’t got one already. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>So my questions, therefore, to – both of them come from those two points. The
                        first one is: When we talk about Southeast Asia, can we really talk about a
                        Cold War? Or are we talking about a fight postwar, in a situation where you
                        had European colonies moving out and various different other powers moving
                        in, and the conflict that that created? Should we find a new term when we
                        refer to the Cold War in Southeast Asia?</p>
                    <p>The second is – and this is, I mean, regarding South Vietnam, which I would
                        know very little about – what would an independent Vietnamese culture,
                        developed after a victory, have looked like under U.S. hegemony?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. PRADOS:</hi> Well, I don’t know the answer to that.
                        Let me go about this this way. I actually got into a lot of trouble a few
                        years ago and kicked up a bunch of dust by making an argument, trying to
                        make an argument, that the Vietnam War was not a Cold War engagement,
                        really, but was an artifact of the Vietnamese Revolution, and it would have
                        happened whether or not there had been a United States intervention. Now
                        many, many of my colleagues who heard me retail this line of analysis
                        objected, and I was never able to establish that as an analytical point.</p>
                    <p>So I think your basic thrust is well taken. I mean, it’s not just about the
                        Cold War. It is, in fact, very much about decolonization and a changing of
                        the age and those kinds of things. And the Cold War is another overlay. And
                        yes, the Cold War certainly contributed to various people’s incentives for
                        doing things that different nations did in this situation. But I agree with
                        you that it wasn’t just about the Cold War.</p>
                    <p>Now, to go on to your other question, I would say this. I don’t think that
                        they had this idea that there was going to be a new Vietnamese society. I
                        think maybe that was just how Dr. Kissinger expressed himself. But if you
                        look at some of these same kinds of discussion memoranda that I was talking
                        about earlier that are in the foreign relations series, you’ll very much see
                        a sense in there that the idea is that a South Vietnamese regime of some
                        character that’s not communist will succeed or endure after the period of
                        United States involvement. And that’s a goal, that’s a choice, that’s a
                        thing that they are seeking. I don’t think they’re looking at it in terms of
                        a particular society with any particular set of norms or cultural
                        traditions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. HERRING:</hi> Another fascinating “what if” is what
                        would have happened if, in 1954-55 after Geneva, the United States had not
                        intervened. There are people in here who probably are better qualified than
                        I to talk about it, but what kind of – would there have been war? Would
                        there have been a negotiated settlement? How would South and North have come
                        together or not, I think it’s one of the more fascinating questions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. ELLIOTT:</hi> Just a – could I just add a brief
                        point? Actually, South Vietnam, as the fascinating research of Lien-Hang
                        Nguyen and Ed Miller have pointed out, did have a rather distinct society
                        and identity. But please keep in mind that the United States was
                        instrumental in overthrowing this very government, the regime that had been
                        created through nine years of American policy, which left the United – and
                        in my view, this was the point, the real turning point of the Vietnam War.
                        This was the last point at which the United States could have walked away
                        from the Vietnam War. But having invested itself in deep intervention in
                        trying to shape an American-designed future for Vietnam, the United States
                        had only the argument that some future Vietnam might develop an identity
                        because it had destroyed the old one.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SCHWARTZ:</hi> Nevertheless, I’m going to go back to
                        Korea. I mean, there was precedent for a divided state in Asia, and South
                        Vietnam might have developed in – especially given some of the changes that
                        took place in the world economy, South Vietnam, if it had been guaranteed,
                        either with a stable military presence by the United States or in some
                        manner, might have emerged as an economically prosperous – another one of
                        the Asian titans. And North Vietnam might have faced the fate that has now
                        seemed to be developed in North Korea. So I do think that’s a big – and I
                        think the – I’m going to borrow a line from the lunch today, where we said
                        never answer counter-factuals. That’s a counter-factual. I think it is a
                        hard one.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. ELLIOTT:</hi> Could I add – just 30 seconds. On the
                        Korean analogy, in the book that I referred to, Yuen Foong Khong’s <hi
                            rend="italic">Analogies at War</hi>, he argues that, contrary to the
                        impression of most scholars of an earlier declaration, it wasn’t the Munich
                        analogy, aggression unchecked is aggression unleashed, that drove
                        policymakers, particularly in the Kennedy period but also the Johnson
                        period. It was the Korean analogy, because the Korean analogy suggested that
                        the United States could be successful in maintaining a divided country.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Rufus Phillips. John, I wanted to correct –
                        I have a question, but I wanted to correct you on one thing. You talked
                        about the generals approaching us. It’s true that there were discussions
                        among the generals. But in fact, it was Lodge himself, based on the cable
                        that came out from Washington and his interpretation of it, that ordered us
                        – and I got involved tangentially – in going to the Vietnamese and helping
                        spur the coup. So – and I was there.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. PRADOS:</hi> Wasn’t that at the later period?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> No, that’s in all – that’s just the week
                        after Lodge arrived. I’m talking about when the cable came out from
                        Washington.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Secondly, I was in Vietnam 1954-55, and
                        also I went up to Laos. I think we have to understand, if we look back at
                        the question of the Domino Theory, that the situation in Southeast Asia was
                        much different then than it became later on because Thailand stabilized,
                        Malaya became stabilized, eventually Indonesia stabilized. So there was a
                        vulnerability there, and all the – if you wanted to see where it came from,
                        all you had to do was go up to Laos.</p>
                    <p>Now I’d like to ask Professor Elliott a question. Since I spent a lot of time
                        down in the delta, and I started the civilian side of what was the
                        counterinsurgency program in ’62 and ’63, is it your contention that the
                        South Vietnamese could never have done anything to overcome the advantages
                        that the Vietcong had? Because if that is your contention, I can give you
                        factual demonstrations of where certain province chiefs and the way they
                        implemented the strategic hamlet program were succeeding. This was during
                        the Diem era. So think that a reading in terms of the cold COIN
                        [counterinsurgency] picture – you may be right about ’71, because I wasn’t
                        there. But I can tell you what it was like in ’63, and it was a mixed
                        bag.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. ELLIOTT:</hi> Well, first of all, I want to
                        recommend that everyone here should read your book, because I read it with
                        great interest – not with entire agreement, and not on that point. I arrived
                        in Vietnam first in 1963 but didn’t start to do serious research in the
                        delta until 1965, so my knowledge here is not firsthand, but let me say that
                        I had the privilege of working with a very close adherent of President Diem
                        who had been cashiered. He was the deputy mayor of security for Saigon and
                        was the one who drove Diem out of the presidential palace to his rendezvous
                        with destiny. And he told me – he was a southerner, Catholic, a strong Diem
                        supporter – that he had been assigned by President Diem to travel around the
                        country to observe the actions of Colonel Pham Ngoc Thao, who I’m sure you
                        remember very well, because Diem suspected – correctly, as it turns out –
                        that Thao was in fact not playing straight with his assignment, and in fact
                        was urging province chiefs to pursue a reckless strategy of accelerated
                        building of strategic hamlets, precisely in order to sabotage the Diem
                        government. And Colonel Phuoc (ph), who remains a close friend, verified
                        that he, in his travels around the country, knew this.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, the strategy, the -- counterinsurgency or pacification strategy at
                        this time, as you well remember, was the so-called oil spot strategy,
                        borrowed back from old French pacification doctrine in North Africa. And I
                        have to say I was dispirited to hear or to read in the Washington Post a
                        couple of weeks ago that this is now one of our strategies in Afghanistan. I
                        won’t go into the details of the oil spot theory. Suffice it to say that it
                        was borrowed from a colonial experience and was applied by an external force
                        to suppress an indigenous force, rarely with lasting success. The French
                        achieved some success over time.</p>
                    <p>And in fact, even as you probably well remember, after the overthrow of Diem
                        the oil spot theory was tried for a year, 1964, and then thrown out with a
                        new pacification strategy, which stressed more community development, hearts
                        and minds, and so forth. And the United States now is apparently trying to
                        pursue both of these contradictory approaches, oil spot and hearts and
                        minds, simultaneously in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>I guess the final point is that my remarks really on pacification were
                        addressed to the 1971 period, because that’s the period which current
                        historical revisionists have cited as proof that the United States not only
                        could have won, won the war, but actually did win the war. And just to be
                        brief – I won’t go through the 1,500 pages of my book – I don’t agree.
                        (Laughter.)</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. HERRING:</hi> One other quick comment on ‘54, ‘55,
                        you’re quite right. I mean, Southeast Asia was very venerable, and the
                        administration, the Eisenhower Administration, was very sensitive to that.
                        The other thing, though, that they saw and knew – all the reports’ estimates
                        of success, very, very low. The prospects for success were deemed very, very
                        low. They eventually decided to go ahead, Eisenhower and Dulles, because
                        they considered it sufficiently important. And also I think there’s some
                        indications that the success they had had in Iran and in Guatemala gave them
                        a sense that you could manipulate situations, even though the prospects of
                        success were dim.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi>(Off-mike.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. HERRING:</hi> Yeah. Exactly.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> I’m working on the impact of the Vietnam
                        War on Thai politics, and it strike me very much that the role that Thailand
                        play in the Vietnam War was missing from the academic attention. And I think
                        the period after the Paris Accord up to 1975, Thailand play a very important
                        role in cooperating with the American Government. I just wonder if John has
                        come across any new evidence on that at all.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. PRADOS:</hi> What you say is absolutely right. There’s
                        a particular sore point in fact as far is Thailand is concerned with United
                        States Government records. For example, for the longest time we could not
                        get declassified anything that had to do with Laos, because at a certain
                        point – and from the beginning there were Thai advisors attached to the CIA
                        secret army in Laos, but at a certain point in the Nixon Administration we
                        made a deal with Thailand and recruited actual Thai combat units. Then it
                        turned out that if we recruited a Thai combat unit we could not legally pay
                        it. So we convinced the Thais to take these combat units and take them out
                        of their army and then they would re-volunteer as part of this CIA secret
                        army, just so we could pay them. All of that was sensitive.</p>
                    <p>And for years every reference to Thai – well, first of all, no documents were
                        let out at all. Then documents were released but everything that had to with
                        Thailand was excised from them. Then after that documents were let out but
                        the words Thai were taken out of every document. Finally, we went to –
                        there’s an Air Force – history of Air Force support for military operations
                        in northern Laos, and when the Air Force did that again we sued – this is
                        now late in the Clinton Administration – because what is the point of this.
                        And in fact, the judgment went against the U.S. Government. And since then
                        they have lightened up considerably on their treatment of Thailand and
                        declassifying documents, to the extent that this new <hi rend="italic"
                            >Foreign Relations</hi> set that’s come out actually contains the
                        Washington Special Action Group conversations about whether we can pay these
                        Thai troops or not going to the Laotian War, and a whole series of other
                        things like that.</p>
                    <p>But much like that problem, I agree with your basic point about largely
                        ignoring the role of Thailand. I mean, in addition to these Thai troops in
                        Laos there’s a Thai regiment then virtually a division in South Vietnam for
                        a considerable period of time. And if you went and looked at records of the
                        Johnson Administration, records of the Nixon Administration, you find hardly
                        any documents at all that pertain to this particular formation, right? And
                        there are Thai medical assistance, and there’s some Thai economic
                        assistance, and there are all those American bases in Thailand, without
                        which our bombing of North Vietnam would have been not possible, strictly
                        not possible.</p>
                    <p>So you’re quite right, and it’s a definite problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> I want to raise an issue that’s been kind
                        of implicit rather than explicit, and that’s the issue of how we as scholars
                        apply moral and ethical judgments towards controversial foreign policy
                        issues. John used the word “morality.” When Henry Kissinger used it earlier
                        today, my reading that he was dismissive of the way in which antiwar
                        activists in the United States took a moral stance towards the war.</p>
                    <p>And yet when we teach this to our students, the overwhelming fact is that
                        somewhere in the order of 3 million Vietnamese were killed during this war,
                        the vast majority were killed as a result of American firepower, and the
                        vast majority of those were not combatants but civilians. And that raises
                        issues, I think, that still play out today in places like Afghanistan and
                        Iraq, where civilian causalities are invariably higher than the causalities
                        among combatants.</p>
                    <p>And it’s a tough issue, I think, for us. We tend to be pretty good as
                        scholars in tracing high-level decision making. But how do we get into
                        complicated issues of morality and ethics in reaching a broader historical
                        understanding about actions of the U.S. government, especially when we’re
                        dealing with conflicts in which the casualty rates are so high among the
                        civilian populace?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. PRADOS:</hi> You can take that. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. ELLIOTT:</hi> Well, I’ll leave this to the other two
                        panelists, but I – (laughter). I do want to point out that one of the themes
                        in my book about what happened during the – among other things, during the
                        later phases of the Vietnam War and the Mekong Delta was that the
                        pacification did involve massive depopulation of the Vietnamese countryside,
                        not only as a result of bombing and the periodic sweep operations, but also
                        as a result of indiscriminate shelling. So they depopulated vast areas,
                        which suddenly appeared as pacified in the hamlet evaluation survey. By the
                        way, should you want to read a truly comprehensive work on pacification,
                        please, I refer you to Richard Hunt’s definitive work on this subject,
                        pacification in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>But I think with respect to that, since the clear, hold, and build, which was
                        – which is the new version of that strategy, is being seriously advocated,
                        was in Iraq and maybe in Afghanistan, that with respect to the moral point
                        the first point is to get it right, that this was a strategy that had huge
                        moral implications, as you’ve just indicated. And are we advocating in – or
                        are we essentially condoning and advocating a strategy called “clear, hold,
                        and build” that maybe based on this Vietnamese experience, a strategy of
                        forced depopulation with massive civilian causalities?</p>
                    <p>So we need to establish the fact first. What’s the origin of this strategy?
                        What were its moral consequences? And then we can debate the inevitable
                        tradeoffs between strategic imperatives and moral judgments. But I think the
                        first point, the historian’s point, is get it right.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. HERRING:</hi> It seems to me that once you – the
                        very fact of intervention in somebody else’s country is inevitably going to
                        create all kinds of moral problems, no matter how you justify it. And the
                        other thing is the American way of war, which causes huge problems, which is
                        firepower intensive and which tries to save American lives by using massive
                        firepower and bombing and these sorts of things. There are some really basic
                        problems involved inherently in intervention.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. PRADOS:</hi> Well, this is definitely a hard one, Bob.
                        As a professor, you’re dealing with students, and the students have moral
                        values and they make moral choices, and all you can really hope to do is to
                        inculcate some feeling for what the dimensions of the moral problem were or
                        are or can be. In the case of Vietnam, all of us who were of that age went
                        through that, all of us, every single one was compelled to come to some
                        choice, some moral choice about what we were going to do. If you read my
                        book, <hi rend="italic">Vietnam: History of Unavoidable War</hi> you’ll see
                        I tell in there – I talk in there about what I did. And I went from some
                        West Point wannabe to a draft counselor as a result of things that were
                        happening in the war.</p>
                    <p>And those things were moral choices, and they had a lot to do with the kinds
                        of phenomenon you’re talking about, about the violence of the war, and the
                        tactics of the war, and the way that the war was conducted, right? And they
                        had to do with the substance of the war. Three million people died. Twenty
                        thousand Americans died during the time that it took the Nixon
                        Administration to – 20,000 American soldiers; I’m not talking about anybody
                        else – during the time it took the Nixon Administration to actually reach a
                        negotiated a settlement in Paris in January of 1973.</p>
                    <p>I was a member of the U.S. delegation that went to Hanoi for this missed
                        opportunities conference that was referred to earlier. And one of the things
                        that the North Vietnamese delegation said there, which included Nguyen Co
                        Thach, who was their foreign minister at the time, was that the same terms
                        that we achieved in January of 1973 had been obtainable in January 1969.
                        Ergo, 20,000 American GIs died unnecessarily and untold numbers of
                        Vietnamese people.</p>
                    <p>Now, there is morality involved in that and embedded in that. And it
                        underlines the importance of choices that people make.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. SCHWARTZ:</hi> Okay. I’m – that’s actually more–
                        well, I’m not going to get into it, but let me close with something else
                        actually as a story. I want to thank the panel for a very provocative
                        discussion. One of my first experiences as a grad student I worked on -- a
                        man, John McCloy, who was involved in postwar Germany. And at his memorial
                        service – and he had been a sponsor of German-American reconciliation. At
                        his memorial service, Helmut Schmidt the chancellor – at that time former
                        chancellor – came and spoke. One of the lines he used is he quoted President
                        Lincoln.</p>
                    <p>And he said one time Lincoln was asked in war – or you have to destroy your
                        enemies. And Lincoln’s response was, “Then I destroy my enemies by making
                        them my friends.” And I do think -- I think one of the astounding things is,
                        of course, the transformation in the American-Vietnamese relationship, which
                        does leave me, I confess, with a sort of strong sense of wonderment, and I
                        guess certainly a more positive sense than maybe some of what we’ve just
                        been saying. But anyway, thank you very much panel. (Applause.)</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">MR. CROWLEY:</hi> We’ll call the last session of the
                        evening to order. You’re the hardcore survivors of a very full and
                        informative day as we complete the first day of our two-day conference on
                        Vietnam. I’m P.J. Crowley; I’m the Assistant Secretary of State for Public
                        Affairs. The shorter title is the State Department spokesman. And this is my
                        contribution to the program.</p>
                    <p>When Ed Brynn and John Carland came to visit me a little over a year ago and
                        said, “We’d like to do this,” I thought it was a great idea. I looked
                        through their ideas on the program. I said we couldn’t do a retrospective on
                        Vietnam without including a panel on the – on how the media viewed the war
                        because it obviously had profound impact, not so much on the result, but
                        certainly on the debate that is continuing even 35 years after the last
                        soldier left Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>For someone of my generation as I reach the end of my sixth decade, on my
                        list of transformative events in my lifetime you got a variety of things –
                        the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the exploitation of space, the
                        dissolution of the Soviet Union, the synergy of the personal computer and
                        the internet, 9/11, of course. These are events that have shaped the life
                        that I’ve lived, but certainly on everyone’s list, perhaps in this room, are
                        two events – Watergate and Vietnam. And together, they fractured the
                        relationship between government and the governed, and transformed the
                        relationship between government and the media. Whether one participated in
                        the war, demonstrated for or against the war, or reported on the war,
                        Vietnam grabbed hold of everyone in America who was alive in the ‘60s or
                        ‘70s.</p>
                    <p>And Vietnam has made an appearance even in the last five presidential
                        campaigns. It has loomed in the shadows as we have debated and executed our
                        strategies in Afghanistan and Iraq. What is perhaps ironic about the ongoing
                        debate is that strategically the U.S. intervention, regardless of the
                        reasons and whether or not those were valid reasons or not, the intervention
                        evolved to the benefit of both the United States and Vietnam. Asia is,
                        broadly speaking, today, peaceful, stable, prosperous, and integrated.</p>
                    <p>But Vietnam was the last war that we fought with a conscript army, which
                        perhaps explains why going to war in Afghanistan has not had the same effect
                        on the American people as going to war in Vietnam. And notwithstanding the
                        24/7 coverage of the Gulf Wars of 1991 and 2003, Vietnam was the first
                        television war and the media were asked to cover both facets of it: the
                        battlefields there and the battlefields here.</p>
                    <p>Some within the military felt and perhaps still feel that the media somehow
                        lost Vietnam. It is a charge without merit, but the media impact on public
                        opinion was undeniable, which is why we have convened a panel of journalists
                        to provide their perspective this evening. And in the aftermath of Vietnam,
                        it took 15 years and some hard work by people including Bill Beecher and
                        others to reestablish a functioning relationship between the media and the
                        military and government, two vital institutions to any functioning democracy
                        including ours.</p>
                    <p>At this point, just to introduce the distinguished lady and gentlemen to my
                        left we will turn the panel over to Marvin Kalb, the Edward R. Murrow
                        Professor Emeritus of Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and
                        the founding director of the Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and
                        Public Policy, and he’s now finishing <hi rend="italic">Haunting

                            Obama</hi>which will be published next spring.</p>
                    <p>He’s joined by William Beecher, a Pulitzer Prize-winning former Washington
                        correspondent for the <hi rend="italic">Boston Globe</hi> – as a Bostonian
                        I’ve read your stuff for many, many years – the<hi rend="italic"> Wall
                            Street Journal</hi>and <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>. He
                        also served as a senior official at the Department of Defense during the
                        1970s and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and he is currently an adjunct
                        professor at the University of Maryland.</p>
                    <p>Morley Safer hardly needs an introduction but I’ll give him one anyway.
                        Joined CBS News in April of 1964 as a correspondent based in the London
                        bureau and he opened CBS News’ Saigon bureau in 1965 and served three tours
                        in Vietnam. It was his 1965 report on U.S. Marines burning the villages of
                        Cam Ne caused a firestorm of controversy when it was broadcast by Walter
                        Cronkite. And he’s now, of course, still a correspondent for <hi
                            rend="italic">60 Minutes</hi> and he’s the author of the best-seller <hi

                    </p>
                    <p>Edith Lederer is The Associated Press’s chief correspondent at the United
                        Nations and she has been with the AP for 44 years. God bless you for staying
                        committed for that long as we watched the – kind of the hemorrhage away from
                        the industry. And she was the first woman assigned full-time to the AP staff
                        reporting the Vietnam War. She also covered the 1973 Middle East War, as
                        well as Afghanistan, the first Gulf War, Northern Ireland, Bosnia, and
                        Somalia and Rwanda. So if you tell us where you’re going next, we’ll be
                        ready.</p>
                    <p>And finally, Barry Zorthian is a communications consultant in the government
                        and public affairs firm of Alcalde &amp; Fay here in Washington, D.C. He – a
                        former foreign service officer and vice president of Time, he has extensive
                        background in government, journalism, and communications. He served 13 years
                        with the Voice of America, is a retired colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps
                        Reserve, but he spent a good deal of time in the foreign service in India,
                        Vietnam, and was a counselor and director of the Joint U.S. Public Affairs
                        Office, in charge of country and media relations there.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, thank you very much, and I’ll turn the panel over to Marvin.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi>P.J., thank you very much. For those of you
                        who have come here expecting Christiane Amanpour to serve as your moderator
                        – (laughter) – I have an enormous apology to offer. (Laughter.) You’re
                        getting me during a time when you all should be having a cocktail, but stick
                        with us for the next hour or so; it may even be interesting.</p>
                    <p>This morning, we heard two senior officials, one a former official. One of
                        them, Secretary Kissinger, spoke with controlled enthusiasm about the media.
                        (Laughter.) He spoke about the big shot journalists who didn’t even read
                        what it is that he actually said during that news conference. And then there
                        was Holbrooke who spoke with, I thought, genuine admiration for what it is
                        that the media gets paid to do, and that’s probably because Dick really,
                        deep down, still wants to be a journalist. (Laughter.) He just got detoured
                        into this world of diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>I think that you have to have lived on Mars to have missed the central role
                        that the media played during the Vietnam War. I don’t think there’s any
                        question about that. Whether you covered it from here in Washington, D.C. or
                        you covered it as Morley did from the field. Whether you’re among the first
                        women who ever served as a war correspondent or whether you were a
                        journalist who then flipped and went into the government and found himself
                        in the uncomfortable position of having to represent what it is that the
                        government meant to say during the 5 o’clock follies in Saigon, but actually
                        didn’t.</p>
                    <p>So I think what we’ll do here is start with Barry Zorthian. And the question
                        for Barry is: How did a nice boy like you get stuck with a job like that?
                        (Laughter.) And try to keep these opening comments – this is for everybody
                        across the board – to roughly five minutes so we’ll have more time for
                        Q&amp;A.</p>
                    <p>Barry, please.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. ZORTHIAN:</hi> Thank you, Marvin. We’re dealing with
                        events of 45 years ago, so if I pass up on some names and dates and events,
                        please forgive me. You’ll all find as you get up in age that memory is not
                        always responsive.</p>
                    <p>I want to refer to, very briefly, four documents which provided the
                        foundation for Uncle Sam’s responses to the media. The first is a personal
                        one, a letter from Ed Murrow when he was director of USIA and he assigned me
                        to Vietnam. And when they give you assignments on troubled places like that
                        they say all kinds of nice things. But on the second page there was a
                        paragraph which in, view of my subsequent duties, you might find of
                        interest. This quotes Henry Cabot Lodge, then ambassador to Vietnam, telling
                        Murrow, “Mr. Zorthian should understand that he will not, repeat, not have
                        responsibility for press relations, newspaper, magazine, television, radio,
                        as I do this work myself.” Mr. Joseph C. (inaudible) embassy press officer
                        with his office in the USIA building, et cetera.</p>
                    <p>That was in February ’64, at a conference in June of ’64 chaired jointly by
                        Secretary Rusk and Secretary McNamara. General Westmoreland, who had come in
                        with three stars his shoulder – on his shoulders to take over from Paul
                        Harkins and Henry Cabot Lodge, recommended to the chairman that I be given
                        responsibility for the both the military and the civilian side effort. That
                        was followed by another typical cable of all the nice things we’re asking
                        you to do, signed off by State, Defense, AID, USIA, and not on here, but
                        CIA. And the key sentence as far as I was concerned, “Barry Zorthian,
                        presently, the country public affairs officer, will assume the
                        responsibilities of overall press counselor. He will retain the title of
                        Country Public Affairs Office with jurisdiction over the total information
                        effects.” Things go on there, but the key sentence in that is that the
                        President has approved this decision.</p>
                    <p>In July, came our basic directive, our guidance, and the key sentence there –
                        this was written by a working correspondent who had gone into government
                        service, Bob Manning of <hi rend="italic">Time Magazine</hi> was at that
                        time at the NSC and came up with this guidance approved again, joint
                        State-DOD-USIA message saying, “It is essential public affairs activities of
                        all elements of the mission to Vietnam be aimed at maximum candor and
                        disclosure consistent with the requirements of security.” The effort to put
                        that life to that sentence and concept is what absorbed me for four
                        years.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we have a post-Tet communication and this is the only other one of
                        this broad guidance to us from the White House, George Christian, press
                        secretary to the Presidency, “We are facing in the next two days a critical
                        phase in the American public’s understanding and confidence towards our
                        effort in Vietnam. And then he calls on us to activate a program using the
                        assets we have in the form of ambassadors, combat generals, and so on.</p>
                    <p>That’s the framework in which I was asked to operate, tried to operate with,
                        I would say, mixed success.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi>Why was there a credibility gap?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. ZORTHIAN:</hi> The credibility gap grew out of a lot
                        things. Let me make the point that I think talking about the Vietnam War is
                        too great a shorthand. There are at least four Vietnam wars, quite different
                        –</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi>(Off-mike.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. ZORTHIAN:</hi> Well, I think it was a hangover from
                        the pre-Lodge period of the so-called Young Turks – Dave Halberstam, Nick
                        Turner, Neil Sheehan, Peter Arnett, who became very critical about the war.
                        At that time, the Vietnamese were not very effective, but General Harkins
                        thought it was important that we not challenge our allies publicly. So even
                        though the Vietnamese had some – God knows, how distorted reports on
                        particular battles, the casualties claimed and so on – Harkins, with some
                        internal difficulty, nevertheless insisted on we accept Vietnamese judgments
                        about the nature of a battle, the result of it. Reporters, these Young
                        Turks, very good journalists, would go out to the field and talk to the
                        people on the spot – the John Paul Vanns, a name many of you may not
                        remember – and hear the exact opposite of what the official version, both
                        Vietnamese and the Americans, was saying.</p>
                    <p>The credibility gap was very – we tried to get rid of it. I don’t think we
                        succeeded completely. But I think we did pretty well on that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> Well, there’s a question about that and
                        we’ll certainly get to it. But Edie Lederer, you were, without any doubt,
                        one of the first women to be covering the Vietnam War, and I’m wondering
                        whether that made any difference to you at all or to the people you had to
                        cover.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MS. LEDERER:</hi> Well, I – it certainly made a difference
                        to me. I was shocked when I got asked to go to Vietnam, and I got shocked
                        for a really – a reason that was very reflective of the 1960s and ‘70s. I
                        did not go to Vietnam until 1972, and I was the first woman that AP assigned
                        full-time to cover the war. And the reason that I was shocked was that when
                        I joined the AP in 1966, every year you would get one of those forms that
                        asks you: What do you want to do when you grow up? And I would always write
                        that I wanted to be a foreign correspondent. But that was impossible because
                        in order to be a foreign correspondent in the AP, you had to work on the
                        Foreign Desk. And the AP had a foreign editor at the time named Ben Bassett,
                        who refused to have a woman on the Foreign Desk. He did not believe that
                        women had what it took to cover wars, disasters, and really go abroad. And I
                        think that that was a view that was not just held by Ben Bassett.</p>
                    <p>So I got to Vietnam in a very strange way. In 1971, I was based in San
                        Francisco. I had been covering a lot of anti-war protests and a lot of the
                        opposition to the war. And I had been to Europe. I had never been to Asia.
                        And with one of my girlfriends, we decided to use a lot of accumulated
                        vacation that I had and we got an around-the-world ticket on Pan Am. And in
                        those days, you could stop every single place that Pan Am stopped, and Pan
                        Am went to Saigon. So we decided, hey, I’ve been writing about the war;
                        she’d – we’d been sort of so involved with it, let’s go stop and see what
                        it’s like.</p>
                    <p>So we went to Vietnam as war tourists – (laughter) – and we – the AP Bureau
                        was terrific to us. We went to the 5 o’clock follies, we got – went on a
                        helicopter ride over the Mekong Delta, and we got back on the plane and then
                        went off to Bangkok. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> Edie, those war tourists were not unusual.
                        They’d come up the Saigon River and get off the cruise ship – little old
                        ladies with cameras, saying, where’s the war? Where’s the war?
                        (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MS. LEDERER:</hi> So that was the summer of 1971. So,
                        imagine my shock the following – the end of the following summer when, out
                        of the blue, I got a phone call from Wes Gallagher, then the president of
                        the AP, and a legendary war correspondent himself from World War II, asking
                        me if I wanted to go to Vietnam. And I said yes, of course, and I went to
                        Vietnam, never having worked on the Foreign Desk.</p>
                    <p>I only found out in the – in 1991 at the end of the first Gulf war, where I
                        ran the AP in Saudi Arabia, my former boss from Vietnam, Richard Pyle, was
                        also there. And at the end of the war, we went out to dinner one night and
                        he said, “You know, I’ve been waiting a long time to tell you this. Do you
                        know why you ended up going to Vietnam?” I said, “Yes, because Wes Gallagher
                        called me and asked me to go and somebody had read that I wanted to be a
                        foreign correspondent.” He said, “No, no, no, no.” He said, “I had been
                        looking to send a woman to Vietnam because there were quite a number of
                        other women who had been in Vietnam – Gloria Emerson. There were a lot of –
                        not many, but a lot of the major news organizations had women in Vietnam by
                        them. He said, “And when you and Nancy showed up in 1971, I wrote Gallagher
                        a letter and said that’s the woman I want in Vietnam.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> Thank you, Edie, very much. The two
                        gentlemen to my right – one covered the war, as I said before, largely from
                        here and the other largely from Vietnam. And I’d like to start with Morley
                        Safer, and I know that you sort of opened a bureau for CBS at that time, but
                        there are a lot of CBS reporters who had been in and out of Saigon and in
                        other parts of South Vietnam before. So what was it like when you first got
                        there? How were you taken up by the story itself?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. SAFER:</hi> I first got there In January of 1965, and
                        you’re right. Peter Kalischer had gone in and out from Tokyo, Kalb had gone
                        in and out – your brother Bernard Kalb – not the other Bernard Kalb. But
                        clearly, as we were setting up a real bureau hiring cameramen – setting up
                        an establishment in Saigon in 19 – in January, February of 1965, so was the
                        American military building what looked like a permanent establishment there.
                        So it was quite clear to me and to many, many others that this – whatever
                        you want to call it, counterinsurgency, police action, whatever that had
                        reached the point of about – I don’t know – 15 or 20,000 advisors, was
                        preparing for a big-time war. They were widening streets. They were building
                        6,000 foot runways out in nowhere, so clearly, there was a plan afoot.</p>
                    <p>And the first step in that was the arrival of the Marines in Da Nang in
                        February of 1965. And at that point it was clear, or should have been clear
                        to everyone, that this was the real thing. That America was going to war.
                        America was not advising Vietnam or helping Vietnam; America was fighting a
                        war. And it was something that many of us – some of us reported, and many
                        others did not. This was an action from which the United States could
                        withdraw almost at will, at any time once the – to give you an example,
                        Ralph Paskman, who I’m sure you remember who was a senior editor at CBS
                        News, when he asked me to go Vietnam, he said, “Look, this thing is not
                        going to last probably more than three months, maybe six.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> He was our foreign editor. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. SAFER:</hi> And it was clear to me that – I may only
                        last three months or six, but this – CBS is in this for the long haul. And
                        it was also very clear that this advisory role was really finished. It was a
                        sham. And the only place the advisors really maintained a very important
                        position was in the Delta, because the Delta was the last part of Vietnam to
                        be occupied – if that’s the word – by full-scale American units.</p>
                    <p>I had not been to Southeast Asia before. I had not been to Vietnam before,
                        certainly, but I had covered a lot of wars at that point in my career in
                        Africa and Cyprus and the Middle East, and it was nothing like what I saw in
                        Vietnam, I mean, in terms of preparation for major, major warfare.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> Morley, tell us about that famous story. Is
                        it --</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. SAFER:</hi> That was in, I think, July or August of
                        1965. Barry might remember. And we maintained a small bureau in Da Nang from
                        which we would cover Marine Corps operations. And we then had, I think, two
                        or three correspondents in the bureau, and we each took turns spending a
                        week or so up in Da Nang, and it was my turn to go up. And we did – you did
                        what the demand by New York was huge for war coverage shoot-‘em-up coverage,
                        that was – their appetite was almost limited to that.</p>
                    <p>So you went down to – went to various units – I didn’t – one afternoon and
                        asked if they were planning any operations. And a particular unit said, yes,
                        we are going to have an amphibious operation beginning at 5 tomorrow
                        morning. I said can we come along? Sure, come along. We went on – we went
                        –</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> Let me interrupt you for a second. Was that
                        a decision reached by the local military chief – in other words, the
                        American in charge of the operations?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. SAFER:</hi> Yeah, it was –</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> It’s nothing that had to be checked with
                        the Pentagon or anything like that?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. SAFER:</hi> No, no, no, this was a lieutenant colonel.
                        It was probably a battalion-sized – a reduced battalion-sized operation. We
                        went on the – in these amphibious vehicles, these Amtraks (<hi rend="italic"
                            >Editor’s Note: Amtraks were amphibious tracked vehicles – armored and
                            used to transport troops</hi>), and I asked a (inaudible) major what the
                        operation was about. And he said, well, it’s a search and destroy mission.
                        Search and destroy was the common phrase for destroy. (Laughter.) And we
                        landed on dry land, moved ahead, Marines in line. There were a couple of
                        single-round shots, which is unusual in a battle situation, and – I mean, we
                        clearly weren’t taking fire. Well, the whole line went nuts and starting
                        pouring bullets into the – there was a young soldier wounded who was beside
                        me who was – and he clearly was wounded by one of his – by friendly fire
                        because he was shot in the ass and that’s – (laughter) – the enemy,
                        so-called, was over there.</p>
                    <p>So that – and that was the only American casualty that I saw. We got into the
                        village and there was a wholesale destruction of the village going on, by
                        fire, by Zippo lighters, as Marvin said, flamethrowers. And clearly, this
                        was the purpose of the mission. And the village of Cam Ne is really a series
                        of Hamlets. There was Cam Ne 1, Cam Ne 2, Cam Ne 3, and Cam Ne 4. We
                        reported the story. The Pentagon denied it, saying that a couple of hooches,
                        as they called them, these huts caught fire and, of course, so (inaudible) –
                        denied the story.</p>
                    <p>And like every Pentagon denial, it comes back to bite them because the next
                        day, Charlie Mohr of <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, who had been
                        in the helicopter above this, had described this wholesale destruction that
                        was going on. Tell me if I’m going on too long here.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> No, I’m going to cut you off in a
                        second.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. SAFER:</hi> Okay. In any case, it should be said – and
                        I think this is really important for you to get an understanding of how we
                        covered the war – that there was virtually no communication with New York,
                        was impossible to get a phone call through. We had something called a slow
                        scan machine, which was a kind of a telex machine that would print a letter
                        about every four seconds. And you could die waiting to find out – (laughter)
                        – what the weather was.</p>
                    <p>But in any case, the reason I tell that is I had no idea of the --</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> Effect.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. SAFER:</hi> -- effect, impact of the story that I had
                        reported.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> Let me interrupt you at this point, because
                        that is an example of one major story done by an American reporter covering
                        the war in Vietnam. Another major story was done by Bill Beecher covering
                        Vietnam here in Washington, D.C. And that story I want Bill to tell us
                        about, but that was another one of these large things that produced official
                        denials that ended up to be silly because they were absolutely accurate
                        stories.</p>
                    <p>Tell us about yours, Bill.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. BEECHER:</hi> Notwithstanding the fact that this
                        morning, Secretary Kissinger said the 1969 bombing of Cambodia was no
                        secret, no secret whatever, <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> said
                        it was. I wrote the story. And at that time, believe me, it was a secret.
                        Years later, when I was an assistant secretary of defense, someone showed me
                        a document signed by Henry Kissinger at the time, early during the Vietnam
                        War, specifically denying to William Rogers, the secretary of state, any
                        information on the bombing of Cambodia. He had no right, no need to know,
                        according to this document. Secret? It was kept from the secretary of state,
                        signed by Henry Kissinger. So it was certainly a secret.</p>
                    <p>I’ll take a moment to tell you how that story evolved. It might be of some
                        interest to you. During the presidential campaign, it was clear that
                        President Nixon was determined to get out of Vietnam, but under what he
                        considered honorable terms. And so I went to several very senior planners at
                        the Pentagon and I said, “Assume you get a call from the White House and
                        you’re asked to give your short list of viable options to convince Hanoi
                        that this is a tougher group coming into power, and that we’re prepared to
                        do something that the others weren’t, and that maybe the game is not worth
                        the candle. What would be on your list?” And the lists were different, but
                        on every list appeared saturation B-52 bombing in Cambodia, where there’s a
                        buildup of arms and manpower. And so I watched and waited and in May of
                        1969, early in the administration of – Nixon Administration, there came news
                        reports of heavy B-52 raids on the South Vietnamese side of the border. I
                        had been there. That made no sense at all. There weren’t targets there for
                        saturation bombing, but there was on the other side.</p>
                    <p>So, no matter how secret any operation is, as any reporter will tell you who
                        covers Washington, there are always people who know about it who aren’t
                        supposed to know about it – executive assistants and this and that, and so –
                        as well as planners and people who carry out policy. So I went to a series
                        of people who were involved in carrying out pieces of the action; didn’t
                        know the whole story, but involved in pieces of the action. And I asked
                        questions and I built a mosaic that clearly told me, speculatively, that
                        this is what was going on.</p>
                    <p>So I went to two very well-plugged in people, one at the State Department,
                        and I laid it out to him and his face took on the agony of somebody going
                        through the birth process. (Laughter.) But he said, “No comment.” And then I
                        went to someone at the White House who was also well-informed and I told him
                        my – what I thought I discovered. And he said, “I’ve never lied to you,
                        Bill, and I won’t start now. Let’s change the subject.”</p>
                    <p>So I knew I had the story. I wrote it, it appeared on page one of <hi
                            rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>. And it wasn’t denied by the
                        Pentagon; they said, “This is speculative.” And when reporters went to their
                        best sources – bear in mind, very few people knew the details – when they
                        went to their best sources and said, “Is this going on,” and the sources
                        honestly said, “If it were, I think I’d know about it, and I don’t.” So the
                        story went nowhere initially, even though it had all kinds of detail. It
                        said that Sihanouk had been briefed. It said that the South Vietnamese army
                        had been briefed. It told the whole strategic concept of why it was
                        happening.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, that’s the story.</p>

                        from Washington, but I made five reporting trips to Vietnam, so I had that
                        experience in the field as well.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> Right, and those of us who did “cover the
                        war,” – quote, unquote – from Washington, D.C. would come upon it in many
                        different ways. And we were, in a sense, closer, because as Morley was
                        indicating, you could barely get through to the office in New York. But if
                        you were here, you were in the bureau, you were right there, the decisions
                        were made as to whether you were going to get on the air or not.</p>
                    <p>In early October of 1969, Richard Nixon did one of his very famous speeches
                        on television explaining American policy in Vietnam. At 3 o’clock in the
                        afternoon, State Department reporters and White House reporters were given
                        copies of the speech. And at 4 o’clock in the afternoon, we were briefed by
                        Kissinger, who was our national security advisor, and he briefed us for a
                        full hour. The president did not go on the air until 8:00 p.m. that night,
                        so that anything that he said, you had an opportunity and a three-hour
                        period of checking with people to see not whether the president was accurate
                        – that was not the thrust of it – but if something seemed very interesting
                        to you and you had already been officially briefed at the highest level and
                        it still stuck in your mind with a large question mark, you had three hours
                        to go ahead and check.</p>
                    <p>One of the issues, then, was the question of a letter from Ho Chi Minh to the
                        president, indicating whether or not we were serious about negotiating. The
                        president was to say in his speech that night that Ho Chi Minh flatly
                        rejected the president’s overture for the opening of a peace conference. It
                        struck me as the beginning of a good story.</p>
                    <p>So I called two friends of mine – good sources, but also friends – who were
                        working at the White House. Each one said the same thing to me. The reason
                        I’m telling you the story is it sort of follows up on what was told to Bill.
                        Both said the same thing: “Marvin, you’re a good reporter. If you think it’s
                        a story, that’s your business. I’m not going to go there with you.” I knew
                        them well enough to know that when I was wrong, they would stop me. When I
                        was right, they didn’t confirm it. They’d just say go ahead. There were two
                        guys at the White House who did that.</p>
                    <p>And then I talked to a couple of people here at State who knew about the
                        exchanges, were part of it, and they, in effect, confirmed it so that when,
                        after the president spoke, we did what was called on CBS instant analysis,
                        we – I told them. I spoke about this. Well, this got the White House so
                        furious that the following day, the president sitting there – the reports
                        were very positive coming into the White House – and he said, “How were
                        things.” “Well, they were just great, except for that son of a bitch Kalb
                        who said blah-blah-blah about the Ho Chi Minh letter.”</p>
                    <p>Following up on that, there were – Bill was subjected to this, too. There
                        were government folks listening in on private telephone conversations,
                        checking up on my income tax, being on the cherished enemies list of Richard
                        Nixon. All of those things came to me, I’m told, as a result of that one
                        story. So that when you were covering something, there was the raw coverage
                        that Morley just told us about and there was the other kind of coverage
                        here.</p>
                    <p>And I’d like to go back to Barry’s last comment when he said that we seem to
                        have taken care of that – the credibility gap. My impression, Barry, is that
                        that lasted for most of the war. Why would a nice boy like you allow such a
                        thing to happen?</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">MR. ZORTHIAN:</hi> I say to you there is no single Vietnam
                        War. There’s that post-Tet period where things fell apart and I think the
                        government got back into bad habits of distortions or exaggerations. I will
                        say flatly the information that came into my hands may have been doctored,
                        but I never put out or authorized disclosure of information that I thought
                        was false.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> And I think we all believe that, those of
                        us who benefited from your information.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. SAFER:</hi> I’d say – may I just interrupt? I want to
                        second what Marvin said about trusting Barry. At least if you couldn’t trust
                        what he said in the briefing, you could trust what he said over a drink.
                        I’ll put it that way. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. ZORTHIAN:</hi> As long as it’s good gin.
                        (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. SAFER:</hi> But I think there were times when he
                        unwittingly gave disinformation when he was given false information and
                        perhaps was neglecting to check his own sources, to be polite.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> Bill. Is that a fair comment, there?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. ZORTHIAN:</hi> Yeah, I think it’s a fair comment. I’d
                        make one other point, which I think is essential. We keep talking about the
                        media. There was no cohesive media. There were critics in the media, there
                        were analysts in the media, and there were some very strong supporters of
                        what the U.S. was doing. So that any image that this was a hundred percent
                        reaction by the media just doesn’t stand up when you analyze it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> No, that’s a very good point, that the
                        media was never and isn’t today a cohesive whole reflecting a single
                        political point of view. And I would like to believe that most of the
                        people, good reporters who work in the media and covered the Vietnam War,
                        were not there to project any point of view, either pro or con, but were
                        there to cover the story as best they could.</p>
                    <p>Bill wanted to have --</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. BEECHER:</hi>I just wanted to add something to what
                        you said a moment ago, Marvin. You mentioned that several of us had our
                        phones tapped, other things. I’ll reveal something that I didn’t write about
                        at the time, but there came a period when the FBI went to offices in the
                        State Department and the Pentagon to secretaries with my photograph, and
                        they showed it to secretaries and they said, “Does your boss know this guy?
                        Does he see him personally or professionally?” It was an attempt, frankly,
                        to me out of business, because it was like I was a child molester and they
                        were showing my photograph around. And I’d never heard of anything like that
                        happening before, but it happened to me. And I remember talking to my bureau
                        chief and he said, “Well, Bill, why don’t we put you on the desk for six
                        months until this cools off?” And I said, “No, they’d win that way. I’m
                        going to work twice as hard,” and I did, and they regretted it.</p>

                        questions as, “Does he read communist books?” (Laughter.) “Does he – did he
                        ever have a copy of <hi rend="italic">Das Kapital</hi> in your library?”
                        This was – this is farce, really.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi>Edie, were you ever subjected to the
                        credibility gap in the sense that you were told something, you reported it,
                        only to find that it simply wasn’t true?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MS. LEDERER:</hi> Yes, I was, but I’d like to just say one
                        follow-up to what Barry said about what happened post-1968. Because, for
                        instance, I was in Saigon during the Christmas bombing of Hanoi and there
                        was a news blackout by MACV on what was happening. And journalists then were
                        using – trying to call all over to try and actually find out the impact, and
                        some of them actually succeeded.</p>
                    <p>And I’d just like to make one point to answer some of the critics like Henry
                        Kissinger about the media in Vietnam. The thing that was terrific for the
                        media in Vietnam was that the media was given basically free and open access
                        to all of the battlefields. You could go down to one of the helicopter
                        bases, get on a helicopter – if there was an empty seat – go out to one of
                        the battle zones, stay for as long as you wanted, and then get a ride
                        back.</p>
                    <p>This changed – this has changed dramatically in every conflict and war that
                        the United States has been involved in ever since. Because the media was
                        blamed for losing the Vietnam War, the next major conflict the U.S. was
                        involved in was the first Gulf War in 1991 and the media was totally
                        encircled; nobody was allowed to go out anywhere without an escort. There
                        were limited pools. You were watched all of the time. I still remember
                        interviewing a general who was sitting facing me, and his PR guy was sitting
                        behind him basically giving him hand signals of whether he should answer the
                        questions or not. To answer –</p>

                        correspondent – a female correspondent at that time wasn’t very easy. It was
                        a very sexist era and people were always trying to sort of take advantage of
                        you or to use you, and I actually got sold a hoax story by a captain – an
                        army captain who claimed – this is when we were all waiting for the release
                        of some of the Viet Cong prisoners, that he – that his guys had picked up
                        some prisoners of the Viet Cong in the jungle, and it turned out to be a
                        total hoax. And why did he do it? Because he thought I was young and cute
                        and he was putting me on.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> That’s fascinating. I had a – (laughter) –
                        I had a conversation the other day with Morley about, not necessarily
                        disappointments in your life as you were covering the Vietnam War, but
                        revelations – events that that happened where you can look back upon it 30,
                        40 years later and say, “Wow, that really did happen.” And I’d like to ask
                        each member of the panel now starting with Morley and just tell us the story
                        about this, and the other three think about yours.</p>

                        both very quickly. One – I don’t know if you ever – you know about this,
                        Barry, but when Bill [Colby] called me – he went on to become director of
                        the CIA, was doing his second tour in Vietnam as a deputy ambassador, I
                        believe.</p>

                        a call to come and see him in his office. And I walked in – and I had met
                        him; we had no strong relationship at all – but – and he said, “Look, can
                        you disappear for three days?” (Laughter.) And I said, “I guess.”
                        (Laughter.) And he said, “Well, be at the airport – be at (inaudible) at the
                        airport tomorrow morning at 5:30.”</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. SAFER:</hi>No, no. And I showed up and he said, “Okay,
                        here are the rules. You can see that I’m going on a tour of all the
                        stations. You can’t take notes and you can’t report anything you hear.” And
                        I spent three days – made – first of all, down in the delta and they were
                        really, really revealing. There was only one meeting that he would ask me to
                        leave the barracks. And it was fascinating because the stuff that these guys
                        were reporting through whatever filters to you had been so doctored by the
                        time it got to you – I mean, to this day, I still feel constrained in terms
                        of talking about.</p>
                    <p>As Telford Taylor once said to me, he said, “Once you know a secret – one you
                        swear to keep a secret, you keep it to the grave.” Well, I keep most secrets
                        to the grave but – and I so I don’t want to go into detail, but – and I’ve
                        often wondered what his motivation was, being a skeptic, why is he doing
                        this, what’s the real story. And to this day, I don’t know unless he was –
                        wanted an uncommitted witness, some – I just don’t know.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> Well, at least Colby did it with you for
                        three days. Think about McChrystal inviting a reporter from the <hi

                        about McNamara.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. SAFER:</hi>When Secretary McNamara finally published
                        his – shall we call it his <hi rend="italic">mea culpa</hi>– I was asked to
                        do this kind of thing with him at the Y in New York and in front of an
                        audience. And the essence of his answers to my questions – and he was a
                        very, very hard man to impress, but I did my best – was, “If only we’d know
                        – if only we’d known that – the nature of the Vietnamese people and their
                        committed resistance. If only we’d known.” And I kind of went nuts with him
                        there because – so what, doesn’t anybody in the State Department read
                        history, or in the Defense Department? And the truth of it was they don’t.
                        Not the people who are there on the ground. The last books any of them read,
                        anyone I knew in Vietnam, including some very learned senior commanders –
                        the last books they read were Bernard Fall’s books about the French failure
                        in Vietnam. And essentially, they came away with the message, “Well, what do
                        you expect from the French? We can do better than this.” No (inaudible) into
                        the history that the nature of the Vietnamese people, their resistance to
                        outsiders, their sense of independence, their resistance to the Khmers,
                        their resistance to the Chinese, their resistance to the French – this, I
                        think, is something in their bones and I don’t think we had a clue about the
                        nature of the people we were fighting.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> Dean Rusk told me several years after he
                        left office that he totally underestimated – we totally underestimated, he
                        said, the tenacity of the Vietnamese people and the tenacity of the
                        Vietnamese leadership. And that went up above Rusk and down below Rusk, as
                        well.</p>
                    <p>Bill, do you have a story to share?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. BEECHER:</hi>Well, one thing that comes to mind – I
                        was a target, often, of the FBI trying to figure out where my sources were
                        on various stories, some involving Vietnam, some involving arms control
                        negotiations and such. They assumed when they did their investigations that
                        these were silver platter stories, which means some source who knew all the
                        information would hand it on a silver platter to the reporter. And this –
                        like the story I told you earlier about the secret bombing of Cambodia, it
                        doesn’t work that way in Washington or anywhere that I know if in my
                        experience, except once.</p>
                    <p>Once, I got a call from someone I did not know. It was the dark of night and
                        he said, “William Beecher, you don’t know me, but I want to come to your
                        house tonight to tell you about something.” And I was a little nervous about
                        it. I had a – (laughter) – wife and four little girls at home and I didn’t
                        know who this was. Frankly, I had a pistol in my back pocket. I didn’t know
                        this man, but I said, “Sure, come on ahead.” I sent them out of the house to
                        go to a movie or something, and he wanted to tell me – this is a silver
                        platter – about a secret plan, a covert plan to provide an awful lot of arms
                        to the Cambodians. At that time, we were not overtly or even covertly
                        supplying them a significant number of mines – the Cambodian army.</p>
                    <p>And I took notes and I said, “I have to confirm this before I write it.” And
                        he said, “Go ahead.” He said, “You won’t find very many sources who know
                        about this.” But I did and I wrote this story and it made a fuss. But in all
                        my experience in Washington, over 25 years, it’s the only time anything like
                        that ever happened.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> That’s fascinating. Barry, level with us
                        for the first time. Come on. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. ZORTHIAN:</hi> I’ll tell you one story. It’s a little
                        coarse, but I hope you’ll excuse me. Every –</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> We’re totally off the record, aren’t we?
                        (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. ZORTHIAN:</hi> Well, this has been in print. But every
                        so often I’d be called back to Washington for consultations – the highlight
                        of which would usually be sitting in on some meeting with President L.B.J.
                        and just getting chewed up because of the performance of the media. One time
                        when we were there – Bill Moyers was then press secretary – we were meeting
                        in the Roosevelt room, door opens, secretary came in and said the President
                        wants to see both of you right away. Up we went to the family quarters; this
                        was shortly after the lunch hour and there’s the President taking his
                        afternoon nap in bed. We open a door, walk in, we don’t get a chance to say,
                        “Good afternoon, Mr. President.” He takes off on the media, “Why can’t you
                        handle them better? Why don’t you get them in line?” et cetera, et cetera.
                        In the middle of one these sentences he threw his blankets off. He only had
                        on half of his pajamas. He went into the restroom, the bath and john that
                        was in that room, relieved himself; it sounded like a horse went.
                        (Laughter.) He came back, got back into bad, dismissed us. We didn’t even
                        have a chance to say “Yes, sir.” (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> Barry, you keep telling us stories like
                        that, we’re not going to invite you back. (Laughter.) Edie, what is your
                        story?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MS. LEDERER:</hi> Oh, come on, this is too tough. I can’t
                        top that story. (Laughter.) Look, I was very young. I had – this was my
                        first assignment overseas. I had been working for the AP for six years, so I
                        covered crime; I had seen bodies and that wasn’t a shock to me. I think what
                        coming face-to-face with the realities of war had a really lasting
                        impression on me, particularly the impact on civilians.</p>
                    <p>Probably right after Henry Kissinger declared, “Peace is at hand,” I got
                        assigned to go and find a Vietnamese family that had suffered great loss
                        during the war. And I found this woman who had lost three sons in the war
                        and her only surviving son was out fighting and she hadn’t heard from him
                        for months. She had no means of support and she was living in a shack that
                        was so poor that the walls were the walls of the neighboring flat and the
                        only thing that she had put over it was one of those corrugated roofs.</p>
                    <p>And I think that, for the first time, really brought home to me the real
                        impact of war on civilians, and it’s something I’ve never forgotten in all
                        of the wars that I’ve gone on to cover. According to the UN, more than
                        three-quarters of the victims of conflict today are civilians, the vast
                        majority of them women and children. And it is – it was a lesson that I saw
                        over and over again in Vietnam, and that I have never forgotten. And I would
                        also, as denouement to my previous story about the hoax, I did learn a big
                        lesson from that, and I am happy to say that in my nearly 40 years since
                        then, I have never been the victim of another hoax.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> That’s great. That’s great. Thank you all
                        very much for those stories, and if you all have questions, this is an
                        opportunity to ask them. I know that there are people, two people I can see,
                        who have microphones. So just raise your hand and I will call upon you.</p>
                    <p>One of – anybody? Up there, please, on the right. Got a hot mike?</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Okay. I have a – sort of a narrow question
                        to ask William Beecher and then a somewhat broader question to the rest of
                        the panel.</p>
                    <p>On the question of the U.S. bombing of Cambodia, you were describing in some
                        detail how that initial story came to be. But I’m wondering about whether
                        you followed up on that story over the next year, if you had any information
                        about the continued bombing of Cambodia? And then in particular, at the
                        point that the U.S. sent troops into Cambodia, President Nixon said that we
                        had been scrupulously neutral up until that moment. I mean, obviously, that
                        must have perked your curiosity.</p>
                    <p>So I’m wondering, at that – if at that point or any point, you were
                        continuing on that story. And I guess a related question is really not just
                        on Cambodia, but also in that same time period – I’m doing research right
                        now. I’m very impressed by how important a part of the story is Laos. And I
                        wonder if others on the panel might comment on the media coverage of Laos
                        and the U.S. role in Laos and the bombing of Laos during that period and
                        clarify that.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">MR. BEECHER:</hi> I did follow it to some extent, but I
                        should point out that in Washington, I wasn’t just doing Vietnam stories. I
                        was doing stories across the whole spectrum, the whole global spectrum. As I
                        mentioned earlier, I did a lot of stories on the negotiations on arms
                        control and a half dozen to a dozen other issues. Yeah, I did some
                        follow-up, and yes, when it was announced when we went into the Fish Hook –
                        what was called the Fish Hook part of Cambodia, that this was the first time
                        that we had violated the sanctuary. That was, shall I say, BS, and – but a
                        lot of reporters at that point realized that.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> As far as the Laos story line-bait is
                        concerned, I can just tell you a brief anecdote. Sandy Socolow is a very
                        good reporter and he was the number-two guy on the CBS Evening News with
                        Cronkite when Cronkite was anchor. And as diplomatic correspondent, I would
                        run around and try to get stories, and when I came up with stories about
                        Laos, they were always rejected. And once at lunch, I asked Sandy, “Why are
                        all the Laos stories being rejected?” He said, “Well, you have to
                        understand, in our minds, it’s the gulf of Laos. It’s just a gulf. There’s
                        nothing there. We don’t want that story.”</p>
                    <p>And it was shot down for a totally silly reason, but it was not considered
                        important enough. If you had something of importance to say on Vietnam, that
                        could get on the air, but Laos did not get on the air even when there were
                        good things happening with Laos resulting in the Geneva conference.</p>
                    <p>Did you have a --</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">MS. LEDERER:</hi> Could I just add a quick note on Laos? I
                        actually went to Laos in 1973 and the thing that fascinated me most about
                        Laos was that it was the one place in Southeast – it was a spy haven. It was
                        the one place in Southeast Asia where you had the North Vietnamese, the
                        South Vietnamese, the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans, the South
                        Koreans, the Americans, and everybody else. And the prime occupation of
                        everybody in Vientiane was spying. It was to try and sort of network. And
                        there was a lot of diplomacy that went on in Laos very, very quietly.</p>

                        with the media – and particularly, I was struck by Mr. Beecher’s comment
                        about finding out, of course, that – or the idea that you would go on six
                        months away made you even more determined to cover. If you feel like the
                        Nixon Administration ultimately became its own worst enemy in terms of the
                        media, that whatever goodwill or that that – in some sense, it turned and
                        created something of the adversarial relationship?</p>
                    <p>And here, I was also thinking of the Agnew speech and the attack on the
                        networks and whether you feel like that – in your own career before and then
                        after, if you feel that was at all a turning point in relationships with –
                        your relationship with the government.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. BEECHER:</hi> I didn’t take the six months on the
                        desk. I continued to work twice as hard as before. But objective as we tried
                        to be as reporters – and we literally do try to be objective and it’s always
                        been part of our credo – you can’t help but react to some of these excesses.
                        I mentioned the use of the photographs. I mean, that’s a Gestapo-type
                        tactic. That’s not an American democracy. That was just dreadful. I mean, it
                        shouldn’t happen in our society. So it had to affect your attitude.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> Also, I think your comment about the Agnew
                        speeches, as far as those of us who worked at the networks were concerned,
                        it was a declaration of war. And there was also something ugly about it. It
                        wasn’t just a disagreement or an unhappiness with coverage. It was an effort
                        to say that a certain part of American society was somehow foreign, they
                        were different, they were not us. And I smell a lot of that going on today,
                        by the way, and I don’t like it. And from my appreciation of that ugliness,
                        that I found in that initial Agnew attack.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> (Inaudible) today about – hearing so many
                        things in the Vietnam War they said were supposed to be secret but yet they
                        weren’t secret at all to anybody. And just hearing your story you relayed
                        about how an individual you didn’t even know just came to you to give you
                        information. With so much we hear about leaks to the media today, being
                        reporters and having your sources, what motivates people? What do you find
                        maybe today or back in the Vietnam era, what was the motivation behind a lot
                        of the leaks?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. BEECHER:</hi> In that particular occasion, I told you
                        it was an isolated case, the only one like it in my entire experience as a
                        reporter in Washington. He really wanted the story out so that the secret
                        program would be spiked. He wanted the story killed. He wanted the covert
                        action killed. It was apparent to me in asking him questions that was his
                        objective. But that – to me, I was just trying to find out what are the
                        facts. And so I went to elsewhere and I wrote the story and it was
                        spiked.</p>
                    <p>But in most cases, it’s not that way at all. Reporters talk to sources, they
                        develop sources over a period of time. There’s a mutuality. There’s a
                        respect. A lot of sources, even with very sensitive information, want the
                        public to be well-informed, and they feel that as citizens, they have a
                        responsibility – sometimes a small one, sometimes a big one – to help inform
                        the public through a reporter. And that frequently, more frequently than
                        anything else, is how a reporter gets information.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. ZORTHIAN:</hi> Let me say a word about secrecy in
                        Vietnam. There were a lot of so-called classified operations that were known
                        to any competent correspondent – Cambodia incursions, the Udorn air base for
                        B-29s in Thailand, on and on. The media, I have to say, was very responsible
                        in protecting that. They did not write – Saigon was like a sieve. The leaks
                        from particularly Vietnamese sources went on and on.</p>
                    <p>Censorship was proposed repeatedly. It was never applied for reasons that
                        were very practical. The Vietnamese Government was the sovereign government
                        in Vietnam. They would have had to exercise the censorship. Vietnam was not
                        made for 600 correspondents’ copies. You have to control the correspondent
                        if you’re going to apply censorship. You have to control him physically. You
                        have to control his communications. There was no way we could have done
                        that.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, correspondents have never, even back to World War II, been
                        censored on political, substantive writing. The only thing the media has
                        accepted and the American public has accepted is protection of tactical
                        military information. And they did agree to observe a number of ground rules
                        – when is an operation going to take place, who’s involved, what are the
                        casualties, and so on.</p>
                    <p>In four years of Vietnam, based on those ground rules, I think we only had
                        six violations, most of which were inadvertent. There was one or two
                        deliberate violations to see what we would do. We lifted back the
                        credentials on some of them. But media’s respect for classified information
                        – in Vietnam, at least – legitimate, classified information was very good.
                        And I don’t think we ought to ever leave the impression that they kept
                        violating.</p>

                        some of which I couldn’t confirm, because they were appalled by some of the
                        excesses of their colleagues.</p>
                    <p>So you – I think that for the most part, in – unlike whistleblowers in

                        anything I’ve ever had in any kind – in any combat situation. I think the

                        <hi rend="strong">MS. LEDERER:</hi> I actually wanted to talk about one
                        issue that really faced not me, but my female predecessors, my female
                        journalist predecessors in Vietnam, because when they arrived, they really
                        had to fight to get on the battlefield to go out and cover the war. And my
                        colleague Denby Fawcett, who worked for the <hi rend="italic">Honolulu
                            Advertiser</hi>, happened to know William Westmoreland because his
                        family had a house not far from her family’s in Honolulu. So she’s out
                        happily covering the war and Westy shows up to visit the unit that she was
                        with and he threw a fit that there was a woman out covering this unit from
                        Hawaii and he banned women from the battlefield.</p>
                    <p>And there was a fight that went all the way up to Robert McNamara and he
                        rescinded the order, but it took quite a few months and every woman who was
                        then in – this was in 1967. Every woman who was in Vietnam then really went
                        to bat to try and reverse this. I have to plug the book that nine women who
                        covered the war, starting in ’65 with Denby, wrote together. And it is very
                        interesting because it’s sort of the history of the war seen through the
                        eyes of the women who covered it.</p>
                    <p>But as somebody who has gone on to cover many other wars, I would like to
                        really pay tribute to the changing times, because by the time the first Gulf
                        War came around, there were women covering the war from many major news
                        organizations. And by the time the war in Bosnia came around, the majority
                        of war correspondents in Bosnia were women.</p>

                        and just start burning. They had to announce they’re coming, which is kind
                        of crazy but that’s what was set. They had to have, in theory, a Vietnamese
                        translator with them at all times and so on. And what you did was you
                        actually changed the way the war was conducted. And it didn’t always happen
                        that way, but it was on the books from then on, and I put that in my volume
                        for the army years ago.</p>
                    <p>And I’m just wondering if other people have seen stories either that they did
                        or that other people did that actually had a real influence on government
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. SAFER:</hi> All I know as I say – I had very little
                        feedback. All I know, and I can’t remember whether it was Barry who told me
                        or Tappie (ph) at – that they had to scrape Westmoreland off the ceiling
                        when he saw the story, and then – and he flew up to Da Nang and, I gather,
                        tore many strips of many marine commanders. But that’s all I know.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. ZORTHIAN:</hi> I’ll give you a case where a story had
                        a real effect on operations, and that was use of tear gas to insert into
                        underground fortifications and so on. Military decide to try it, see if it
                        was effective, and authorize one of these units up towards the north to do
                        so. It just happened, pure accident, that Peter Arnett and Horst Fos --</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> AP reporter and cameraman.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. ZORTHIAN:</hi> -- were in that area and ran across the
                        usage of tear gas. They wrote a story that day without asking anyone or
                        clearing it. I’m told the Tokyo bureau, through which their copy went,
                        changed their terminology and talked about nonlethal gas being used as an
                        instrument of war that went out worldwide, story to that effect. It led to
                        riots in Europe, very negative coverage in the U.S. Nonlethal gas was
                        interpreted as poisonous gas, dangerous gas; God forbid it be identified as
                        tear gas.</p>
                    <p>Two weeks later, you couldn’t get a paragraph in the – because once it was
                        revealed MACV started using it, it was not very effective. But it never got
                        straightened out. It’s the type of thing that the military just isn’t used
                        to communicating in advance. If we had briefed the correspondents in
                        advance, if they – we had put them through a trial use of it, they might not
                        even have covered the story because it wasn’t that well known.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> Barry, thank you very much for that story,
                        and to all of the other members of the panel, thank you very much for your
                        stories and thanks to the History Department – is that what you’re called
                        here at the State Department?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. CROWLEY:</hi> The Office of the Historian in the
                        Bureau of Public Affairs. But I could use the convener’s prerogative to ask
                        one last question for you to be able to sum up, and I’d like to draw from
                        what Barry talked about with the issue of the credibility gap. For each of
                        you in your various experiences in Vietnam, at what point in your judgment
                        did the gap become so wide that if “tipping point” was the right term – I
                        know there’s a school of thought that the war pivoted when Johnson lost
                        Cronkite.</p>
                    <p>But – and Morley said that there were – there was – the credibility gap might
                        have been visible as early as 1965. But is there a point at which that gap
                        became profound enough that it – the turn in public opinion became almost
                        inevitable?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. SAFER:</hi> I think the best answer to that question
                        is going to be given by Barry because he was on the receiving end of – and I
                        think that to a large extent, by ’67 and by ’70, which was the last time I
                        was – I went back to Vietnam, we didn’t even bother with stuff that came out
                        of the briefing process, largely because it was – it really wasn’t very
                        interesting, true or false. You still could – you could really get much
                        better stories by being out in the boondocks and talking to even young PIO
                        guys in some of the units. And so Saigon was a rumor mill capital of Vietnam
                        and you really had to go out. And once in the field, there was no
                        credibility gap at all, in my experience.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. KALB:</hi> Okay. But two quickies here: One was that
                        the CBS Evening News found that the credibility gap had reached a point of
                        such acceptance by the American people that it became a source of humor. And
                        quite often, there would be a piece from the field – Morley or somebody else
                        – doing a piece from Vietnam. And I would do a piece from Washington and it
                        would be about the same issue and it would be two worlds. There would be one
                        world, the Morley world, which was real and then I would say, “And this is
                        what the State Department and the White House are saying today,” and it was
                        unreal. But that’s how bad it became. It became a source of humor.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. BEECHER:</hi> And they both made a point that I would
                        like to add to, and it’s a matter of coloration. When I would talk to
                        officials in Washington, there was great optimism about what was going on,
                        body counts and all that. When I went on the way to Vietnam and stopped at
                        CINCPAC headquarters at Pacific Command and there was a slightly more
                        accurate view but still highly colored, I’d get to Saigon and official
                        spokesmen – not necessarily Barry – but official spokesmen would tend to be
                        a little bit more accurate and a little less saccharine. But you go out to
                        the field and you get a straight story, and it was a matter of coloration
                        that was different from Washington at each step until you got down to the
                        grunts and the officers.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MS. LEDERER:</hi> I’m going to give Barry the last word.
                        The only thing I wanted to say was that by the time I got there in 1972,
                        there was no credibility. It was gone. And it was more of a joke. I mean,
                        the 5 o’clock follies were really viewed as the follies, and because
                        reporters could go out in the field and see for themselves, that, by that
                        time, is the only thing that news organizations were relying on.</p>
                    <p>Barry.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. ZORTHIAN:</hi> My last word is I get a feeling
                        sometimes – this is, what, 45 years after I left Vietnam – that the Vietnam
                        War is going to be like the Civil War. There will be books coming out on it
                        analyzing these questions for the next hundred years.</p>

                        there and what’s being said here, I would suggest that you’ve got a
                        problem.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">MR. CROWLEY:</hi> On that as the last word. (Laughter.) As

                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR. BRYNN:</hi> Again, I’m Edward Brynn,<hi
                            rend="strong"/>the acting historian, I welcome you again. I’ll apologize
                        a little bit for the weather, but that’s the responsibility of the CIA.
                        (Laughter.) Might I remind you if you would be so good as to turn off cell
                        phones and that type of equipment? Again, you are now completely familiar
                        with the badge situation. Make sure each time that you go out that you
                        surrender your badge to the counter where you collected it, and pick it up
                        again when you come in. Otherwise, you will fall into the same dilemma that
                        the Kingston Trio, many years ago, sang about. It was the MTA, I think, in
                        Boston. You’ll never get out of here.</p>
                    <p>We will start as close to 9:00 as possible with our first speaker being
                        Ambassador Negroponte. And we’ll follow the same format that we had
                        yesterday. His remarks will be followed by a question and answer period. We
                        will stop precisely at 10 o’clock. That will be my job, to keep some element
                        of discipline in this unruly crowd.</p>
                    <p>Now that the masses have been allowed in, let me repeat what I said just a
                        few minutes ago. I will do it in special English for this group. First of
                        all, please turn off your cell phones and other electronic devices. I have
                        to congratulate all of you. Yesterday, I don't think there was one violation
                        of the – of that precept. This is a very attentive crowd.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, make sure that when you go out of the Marshall area for any reason,
                        that you surrender your badge at the desk where you picked it up and then
                        retrieve it when you come in. If you can’t remember your name, we’ll use our
                        backup procedures to help you in that area.</p>
                    <p>The program today will be following the same format that we used yesterday.
                        The first part of the program will be an address by Ambassador Negroponte. I
                        will do a brief introduction of him. He will speak. He will have time for
                        Q&amp;As. I will be absolutely ruthless in stopping this whole procedure at
                        10 o’clock so that we can stay on schedule as much as possible for the rest
                        of the day.</p>
                    <p>Okay. Let’s begin. Again, I’m Edward Brynn, the acting historian for the –
                        for this time. We are pleased to have you here. This is the sixth in a
                        series of programs focusing on major events in American foreign policy. We
                        have really enjoyed the support of the Bureau of Public Affairs and the
                        Assistant Secretary, P.J. Crowley, and his staff. We were delighted that
                        Secretary of State Hillary Clinton could join us yesterday. And of course,
                        all of you remember the contributions of Dr. Kissinger and Ambassador
                        Holbrooke yesterday at the beginning of the show.</p>
                    <p>This morning we are going to continue on the same level of quality. We have
                        Ambassador John D. Negroponte, a career diplomat and national security
                        officer who held increasingly senior U.S. government positions abroad and in
                        Washington between 1960 and 1997, and again from 2001 to 2008. He has been
                        ambassador to Honduras, Mexico, the Philippines, to the United Nations, and
                        to Iraq.</p>
                    <p>His Vietnam War assignments are of special interest to us today. He was
                        posted to the American Embassy in Saigon from 1964 to 1968. He was a member
                        of the U.S. delegation to the Paris Peace Talks on Vietnam from 1968 to
                        1969. Ambassador Negroponte served as National Security Council director for
                        Vietnam under Dr. Henry Kissinger from 1970 to 1973, and later as deputy
                        national security advisor under President Reagan.</p>
                    <p>Here in Washington, Ambassador Negroponte served as assistant secretary of
                        state for Oceans and International Environment from 1985 to 1987, and as
                        deputy national security advisor from 1987 to 1989. He served in President
                        George W. Bush’s cabinet from 2005 to 2007 as the first Director of National
                        Intelligence. He was Deputy Secretary of State from 2007 to 2009.</p>
                    <p>In the private sector, Ambassador Negroponte directed McGraw-Hill’s
                        international agenda from 1997 to 2001, and since early 2009 has been vice
                        chairman of McLarty Associates, an international strategic advisory firm in
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>Twice Ambassador Negroponte received the Department of State’s Distinguished
                        Service Medal, and President Bush awarded him the National Security Medal
                        for his contributions to U.S. national security on January 16, 2009.</p>
                    <p>I had the distinct pleasure to be seated beside Ambassador Negroponte
                        yesterday, a man of real Renaissance qualities, and I’m looking forward to
                        hearing him talk today. Ambassador Negroponte, over to you.</p>
                    <p>(Applause.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE:</hi> Thank you very much, Ed. I
                        appreciate the kind introduction, and I’m delighted to be here today.</p>
                    <p>I thought – just to give you one of my perspectives, I thought I’d read just
                        a few passages from some papers I wrote back in 1969. I had a – after being
                        in the Paris Peace Talks in our delegation from May of ’68 through the
                        summer of ’69, I was assigned as the first fellow, State Department fellow,
                        at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. And so I wrote six papers,
                        which I’ve never published, about my experience in Vietnam up to that point,
                        and I thought I’d just read a few passages to you.</p>
                    <p>I wrote a paper on the negotiated solution. This is September 21, 1969. “Many
                        of us talk about a negotiated solution to the Vietnam conflict. What is a
                        negotiated solution? How does one go about attaining it, and is it really
                        attainable, taking into account the realities both on the ground in Vietnam
                        and here in the United States?”</p>
                    <p>And then towards the end of the paper – I’ll spare you the next 15 pages – I
                        wrote, “If my pessimism about the prospects of a meaningful negotiated
                        solution has not already become apparent, I will now state it flatly. It
                        seems to me that virtually all of the reasonable options facing us in the
                        coming months or years leads to outcomes sharply different and less
                        favorable than those to which we committed ourselves several years ago.
                        While none of us have the privilege of sitting in on meetings of Hanoi’s
                        Politburo, I’m sure it is a fair guess that when the decision was reached to
                        come to Paris it was made on the basis that the minimum necessary would be
                        done to get the United States to stop the bombing and withdraw its troops,
                        but that nothing, absolutely nothing, would be done to jeopardize its
                        long-term goal of communizing and reuniting with the South. I think Hanoi
                        has the resources and patience to continue to pursue the above-stated goal.
                        Any so-called negotiated solution will likely be a face-saving camouflage of
                        our inability to achieve in Vietnam anything resembling our initial
                        objectives. The principal reason for this failure was precisely our
                        underestimation of Hanoi’s resources and patience and a converse
                        overestimation of our own.” That was one paper I wrote.</p>
                    <p>The other is a little less, in the slightly less serious vein, but it goes to
                        an issue that’s been very dear to my heart ever since my service in Vietnam,
                        which is the importance of language and area expertise in our foreign
                        service. And I wrote on the subject of language because I was very taken, if
                        you will, struck by the difficulty of communication that we had in Vietnam
                        and the difficulty of reaching understanding with our Vietnamese
                        interlocutors.</p>
                    <p>And I wrote here, “Perhaps the most relevant thing I can say about the
                        Vietnamese language is that hardly any American I know speaks it.” That’s
                        all I want to tell you about that particular section.</p>
                    <p>I then go on to explain the difficulties of learning Vietnamese, the fact
                        that we were very late to start training our officials, and how hard the
                        language was. I mean it’s on an order of difficulty similar to Chinese. And
                        those of you who are Foreign Service Officers and who have studied
                        Vietnamese or Chinese know that it takes years even to get the most
                        rudimentary knowledge of the language. In fact, there were missionaries in
                        Vietnam, and I was impressed by the rule of thumb that they would give us.
                        They would frequently say that it took about 10 years for a missionary to
                        get to the point where they really felt that they could teach religious
                        scriptures and the kinds of things they wanted to teach in the Vietnamese
                        language.</p>
                    <p>The nature of the war – we were talking about that yesterday in many
                        different guises. What kind of war have we been fighting in Vietnam? I wrote
                        this on September 29, 1969. “What kind of war have we been fighting in
                        Vietnam? What have been our objectives? What are the nature, capabilities,
                        and resources of the enemy? These and similar questions are ones to which
                        we, one would have thought, clear answers would have been sought long before
                        we committed ourselves in Vietnam to the extent we actually have. It is
                        quite apparent, however, that it is the very absence of adequate answers to
                        questions such as the foregoing which has led our Vietnam policy into such
                        difficulties.”</p>
                    <p>And then I wrote a paper on the issue of what is really going on out there.
                        That was the title of the paper. And I started that paper by saying,
                        “Perhaps no question disturbed us more in Vietnam than that of arriving at
                        an accurate assessment of –quote – progress – unquote in the war. The same
                        question has nagged the American people as a whole, and it is obvious from
                        skepticism repeatedly expressed by both right and left, Hawk and Dove, that
                        official reporting on progress of the war has never been particularly
                        convincing.” And that is an issue that throughout the rest of my career I
                        found to be a very significant one, whether – with respect to the situation
                        in Iraq or in Afghanistan or elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>Now, that was a snapshot of how I felt about our involvement in Vietnam at a
                        particular point in time, I’d say perhaps a particularly pessimistic point
                        in time in my own personal evolution. I think that later on my attitudes
                        changed. In fact, I’d say that like many of us who were so much engaged in
                        the Vietnam conflict and having worked on it for more than a decade, I’d say
                        that I found myself pretty much all over the place over the years in terms
                        of how I felt about the war. And those of you who worked in Saigon or
                        elsewhere in Vietnam know how often we would spend long nights after work
                        debating the course of the war, debating the nature of the United States
                        involvement, debating whether – what the outcome might be. And our evenings,
                        although as interesting and lively as they might have been, always ended up
                        very inconclusively.</p>
                    <p>So how to think about Vietnam and how to teach our children about Vietnam?
                        There’s so many ways to think about it. I mean, if one thinks of it in a
                        200-year sweep of history, then perhaps one can think of Vietnam as a
                        country whose nationhood was interrupted by a French colonial adventure and
                        that once the French left, the process of reestablishing complete nationhood
                        over the entire Vietnamese territory was resumed. So I suppose that’s one
                        way of thinking about it. And I don’t know what the history books will say a
                        hundred or two hundred years from now.</p>
                    <p>Obviously, we can think of it as an American experience in addition to, of
                        course, being an extremely important Vietnamese experience. And in that
                        regard, much has been written, movies have been made, we have lived through
                        our own agony about Vietnam. I think that’s one of the things that for those
                        of us who were serving out there, at least for myself, I don’t think I ever
                        had sufficient appreciation of what Vietnam was doing back here in the
                        United States. It was kind of remote to those of us who were out there and
                        what we felt were the front lines. And I don’t think any of us anticipated
                        some of the issues that arose with respect to the treatment of our
                        servicemen and some of the issues of veterans in – from – the Vietnam War
                        had when they returned to the United States. And I guess certainly one of
                        the lessons learned from that experience has been that I think there’s been
                        a lot more done to try and take care of our returning veterans in the
                        conflicts they’ve been involved in. Subsequently there are other problems,
                        but I think certainly the attention to our veterans has improved over the
                        decades.</p>
                    <p>And then, of course, we can look at Vietnam – and that was referred to many
                        times yesterday, and I thought most eloquently by Ms. – by Secretary Clinton
                        – about the current context of the United States’ bilateral relations with
                        Vietnam, our relations with ASEAN, and our relationship with Vietnam in the
                        framework of the overall East Asia Pacific region. Frankly, that’s the way,
                        to the extent that I think about Vietnam today or I did in my job as Deputy
                        Secretary of State, that was the principal way in which I thought about
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>I didn’t go back to Vietnam. We signed the Paris Peace Agreement in January
                        of 1973 and I did not return until 2008 as Deputy Secretary of State. And it
                        was really a very interesting experience. And I went to Hanoi for the first
                        time. I had not been to Hanoi previously. And then I went to Ho Chi Minh
                        City as well and I was very pleased by the welcome that I received. And
                        everybody comments about this. I guess I first became aware of the
                        Vietnamese desire to reach out to the United States, personally aware, and
                        of the strong desire on the part of Vietnam to restore relations with us in
                        1995 during the time that I was an ambassador in the Philippines. And I
                        struck up a friendship with the then Vietnamese ambassador in the
                        Philippines, and I just couldn’t get over the enthusiasm that this
                        counterpart of mine had for the United States. And of course, the difficulty
                        that we had had up until just about that time to establish relations,
                        reestablish relations, with Vietnam. In fact, I for one, like many others
                        who were involved in the Vietnam conflict one way or another, really felt
                        that we took too long to establish relations with Vietnam. I think sometimes
                        we hold grudges for too long against our own better interests.</p>
                    <p>And I was also pleased at the time to note that some of the strongest
                        advocates of our relationship with Vietnam were people who had been
                        prisoners of war no less. John McCain, our first ambassador there, and so
                        forth. So I see our relationship with Vietnam as a positive thing. I was
                        impressed by the dynamism of the Vietnamese economy. You can’t help but be
                        impressed by what’s happening down in Hi Chi Minh City and some of the real
                        estate development projects, the infrastructure projects that are going
                        on.</p>
                    <p>And frequently, when people talk about ASEAN, the ASEAN group of countries,
                        they often list Vietnam as the most – the single most promising economic
                        prospect at this particular point in time. I think there are other countries
                        that have some inherent advantages but that they have not yet fully
                        exploited, such as Indonesia. But Vietnam is in a very dynamic phase of its
                        development, and that is a very positive thing.</p>
                    <p>The other interesting thing about the welcome I had, I happened to have
                        married a Catholic. I’m Greek Orthodox but my wife is an English Catholic,
                        which is somewhat of an unusual thing. And she had originally planned to
                        come with me on that trip, had wanted to but for family reasons could not.
                        And the reason she wanted to come was that we had met in Vietnam. Her uncle
                        was the British ambassador to Vietnam and he had introduced me to her at a
                        dinner party he gave in 1967. And that’s how we first met.</p>
                    <p>So she had wanted to come with me but could not. We had arranged, in the
                        meanwhile, to go to a mass at the cathedral in Saigon, and so I stuck to
                        that plan even though my wife wasn’t with me. And the parish priest greeted
                        me beforehand, we had a cup of coffee, then we went to the mass. And what I
                        thought was interesting was that before saying the mass he announced to the
                        congregation who I was and explained that I had been (inaudible) and I’d
                        been in Vietnam 40 years earlier and so forth. And everybody stood up and
                        applauded me. I thought that was the nicest thing and I was a little bit
                        surprised. My Vietnamese isn’t good enough to be able to tell whether maybe
                        he just told them to stand up and applaud me. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>I want to get to – I know you all talked quite a bit about lessons learned
                        yesterday, but I want to touch on a couple of things first, and then I do
                        want to apply some of the experience that I gained in Vietnam to what I did
                        later on in the Foreign Service. And of course, the reason I want to do
                        that, and a rather significant difference, say, between the career of
                        someone who’s 87 years old like Henry Kissinger and was a political
                        appointee for one eight-year period, and myself, who spent 44 years in
                        government, is that after the signing of the Paris Peace Agreements in 1973,
                        I went on to have about 36 more years of government service off and on.</p>
                    <p>So really, I had my career ahead of me and Vietnam was a very sort of early
                        stage experience for me. But you know people are always asking about the
                        what-ifs in history, and some people think that’s an exercise in futility,
                        and others kind of enjoy doing it. And I do from time to time, and I have a
                        couple with respect to Vietnam because they were really water – it’s really
                        a way of elucidating what I think were sort of watershed events in Vietnam’s
                        history and from the U.S. perspective. And I suppose the most important one
                        in my mind is what if FDR had lived longer. Franklin Roosevelt died in April
                        of 1945 and we all know the huge debates and arguments that he had in his
                        correspondence with Winston Churchill about the importance of the Europeans
                        giving up their colonies after the war. And he felt very strongly about
                        that.</p>
                    <p>And then if you look at what actually happened, what actually happened was –
                        and Kurt Campbell made a reference to it with a number of us yesterday at
                        our small luncheon – the European Bureau got a hold of the policy,
                        effectively, after the war and said to Truman and the powers that be that
                        we’ve got to help these European countries, particularly France, we ought to
                        help them get their colonies back because it’ll be – basically, it’ll be
                        good for their morale. I mean, that was sort of what they were arguing, and
                        that it would make them feel good about themselves again.</p>
                    <p>And we helped France come back to Vietnam, whereas you know it’s equally
                        plausible to think that perhaps if Roosevelt had lived another year or two
                        that he might have said, well, yeah, this fellow Ho Chi Minh, he’s declared
                        independence, let’s try it out. I mean, why not recognize it? I don’t know.
                        But it, in any event, was a watershed moment.</p>
                    <p>The really big moment that I lived through was the overthrow of Ngo Dinh
                        Diem, which was truly a landmark event back in 1963. I was studying
                        Vietnamese at the Foreign Service Institute at the time, but when I got out
                        to Saigon in May of ’64 on Buddha’s birthday – I remember it was Buddha’s
                        birthday – there was a whole group of officers, political officers and
                        others at the embassy who were really very chagrined by what had happened.
                        They thought that Diem was a real patriot, that he was a real nationalist
                        who had his – his offenses had been exaggerated and exploited, and that the
                        Buddhist movement was, the militant Buddhist movement was, frivolous and so
                        forth. I mean, that was the view.</p>
                    <p>But perhaps more importantly, I think the view also was that he was the kind
                        of nationalist who would have been more reluctant than his military
                        successors, and he was mostly succeeded by military officers in positions of
                        leadership in South Vietnam, to invite so many American troops into this
                        country. Who knows? But it was an interesting question and very often
                        raised.</p>
                    <p>Another – and this isn’t really a what if, but it goes more to the issue of
                        analysis and a subject that was – became dear to my heart when I was
                        Director of National Intelligence. And that is the good strategic analysis,
                        not tactical intelligence and not knowing what’s going on day to day –
                        that’s very important too, particularly when you’re in the heat of battle.
                        But what about how much did we really understand of the Sino-Soviet split? I
                        mean, today we all know that the Sino-Soviet differences really go all the
                        way back to the 1950s, the late 1950s when Mao really became offended by the
                        treatment that he felt he was being accorded by the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>And yet I believe that President Johnson and his administration tended to
                        view the communist bloc as a monolith. They were, in a way, playing off
                        their earlier experiences. And I don’t think that the fact of the
                        Sino-Soviet split had really sunk in. A lot of it was in rhetoric or in the
                        reduction of the size of aid missions. It wasn’t anything dramatic, and
                        nothing so dramatic as the incident on the Ussuri River that occurred in
                        1969. But it was a serious split nonetheless. And you wonder whether, if
                        we’d really appreciated that more, whether that might have created
                        opportunities in our Vietnam policy.</p>
                    <p>And then last, of course, what if Mr. Nixon had not been undone, or undone
                        himself, if you will, politically in 1973 and 1974?</p>
                    <p>I have a list of myths here. I just – because, again, we go to the question
                        of, how do we teach the Vietnam War to our children and to our
                        grandchildren? I certainly think it’s a myth that it was an unjust war. I
                        didn’t feel that I was involved in an unjust war at the time and don’t
                        believe so now. It’s a war we happen to have lost.</p>
                    <p>And I’ve already mentioned the question about China and Russia being a
                        monolith.</p>
                    <p>That the Tet Offensive was a military defeat, Henry referred to that
                        yesterday. I was struck by that – how at the time, what seemed like such a
                        dramatic happening and how could so many provincial capitals all be attacked
                        at the same time, and what did this say about their capability? And it
                        really took much longer for the fact to sink in that basically, many, if not
                        most, of the Viet Cong had been killed during that particular episode and
                        that it had really actually helped contribute to an atmosphere of security
                        throughout the South Vietnamese countryside for the next couple of
                        years.</p>
                    <p>The myth that the ARVN, that the South Vietnamese army, was hopeless – I
                        think they got pretty good, frankly. I thought the way they dealt with the –
                        what we called the Easter Offensive in 1972, several of their divisions, at
                        least, acquitted themselves extremely well.</p>
                    <p>And I don’t know if it’s a myth. I mean, I think maybe it’s a little more
                        nuanced than that, but the question of whether the Government of South
                        Vietnam was a corrupt and failed government. I – compared to a number of
                        governments I’ve dealt with in subsequent years, I’ve got to say that I
                        found, based on my recollection, the Government of South Vietnam a perfectly
                        normal developing country government, if you will. It had weaknesses, but it
                        also had strengths. It certainly had a structure, a functioning structure,
                        throughout the country and institutions that were reasonably healthy, none
                        of which in the end could withstand a conventional assault from outside of
                        their border.</p>
                    <p>The lessons learned, and this really goes to the question of Iraq and
                        Afghanistan and many subsequent experiences for me, but I guess it’s pretty
                        simple. Be careful before you take the first step, because once you get in,
                        then you just – you lose a little bit of control about the next ones and the
                        consequences. And it becomes harder to decide to disengage. And you create
                        expectations. I mean, the United States is still the United States. We’re
                        still, even with all the troubles we have today, we’re still the most
                        powerful country in the world. People still look to us to provide – to play
                        a leadership role around the world, and we undertake a commitment. People
                        have a reasonable right to expect that we will carry through on it. So I
                        think that’s really the most important lesson, from my point of view.</p>
                    <p>And I would venture to you that after Afghanistan, however that unfolds, I
                        think you’re going to see another period of the – sort of the Vietnam
                        syndrome, another 20, 30 years, where, if – and maybe even longer before we
                        ever are willing to commit American forces abroad in that kind of a conflict
                        on such a large scale.</p>
                    <p>And my next point. I guess, is pretty much related to it, and Henry said it
                        yesterday; when you’re in one of these situations, you need great clarity of
                        purpose and a thorough understanding of both the local situation and the
                        surrounding international circumstances. Easy to say; harder, perhaps, to
                        do.</p>
                    <p>I had the honor and the privilege to be Colin Powell’s deputy when he was the
                        National Security Advisor. And I’d been a diplomat in Vietnam, and about the
                        same time – you can read it in his own autobiography – he’d been an advisor
                        to an ARVN unit up in First Corps. I happen to have been, for part of my
                        career, consul – acting consul in Hue. So I even knew that territory a bit.
                        But he felt very strongly about this. You know that. The Powell Doctrine, it
                        was shaped, really, by his Vietnam experience. And he really carried it out.
                        I was amazed. During the Gulf War in 1990, I mean, laser-like in terms of
                        his purpose, and also in terms of building up sufficient force so that he
                        was – to deal with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in such a way that victory
                        was assured and rapid victory was assured. I mean, there was no ifs, ands,
                        or buts. Of course, the Vietnam type situation was very different.</p>
                    <p>I think another one of the lessons that I took from Vietnam, and directly,
                        was I felt that we started our Vietnamization program much too late. With
                        all respect for the late General Westmoreland, I think his fundamental
                        mistake was that he really wanted all the fighting to be done, the real
                        serious fighting with the North Vietnamese units, wanted it to be done by
                        American troops. I sat at mission council meetings in the embassy in Saigon
                        – they were presided over by Ellsworth Bunker – when Westy briefed us on his
                        strategy. I – must have been 1967 or so. And he was talking about the U.S.
                        troops being in the middle, the North Vietnamese troops being out there and
                        the South Vietnamese villages down here with the ARVN protecting the
                        populated areas. And I heard the presentation and I said to myself that this
                        has got to be a prescription for just our indefinite involvement here.</p>
                    <p>Abrams came too late, regrettably. I mean, talk about another “what if.” I
                        mean, if LBJ – apparently, he debated whether to choose Abrams or
                        Westmoreland in 1964 when he replaced Paul Harkins as commander. And if he
                        had chosen Abrams, we might have had a different strategy in Vietnam, and
                        that might have made some difference, at least to the extent of our troop
                        involvement.</p>
                    <p>But like a broken record, subsequently with respect to Afghanistan, with
                        respect to Iraq, I’ve – I was one of the ones who has always been pounding
                        the table for the Iraqization, the Afganization. You know, what are you
                        doing to train the local forces, the local police, the local military to
                        take this on as quickly as possible?</p>
                    <p>Just to give you one very concrete example, when I went to Iraq as the first
                        sort of post-occupation ambassador, I had been asked to review our $17
                        billion reconstruction program. And I found, my goodness, we’re not in a
                        reconstruction phase. This is now July of – June, July of 2004 – we’re still
                        – we have an incipient insurgency here, and it’s actually getting worse, not
                        better. I mean, it’s – reconstruction is simply the wrong term, and we’ve
                        just got to divert more resources to training. There was one army battalion.
                        The army had been dissolved, you may recall, the Iraqi army, and there was
                        one army battalion in existence, and we were starting to try and cobble
                        together a new Iraqi army, and I got – I persuaded Washington that we needed
                        to reprogram about $3 billion of those funds to the training and equipping
                        of the Iraqi army and police, because whatever you think about rural
                        development, pacification, different types of civil programs, you can’t
                        carry them out if you don’t have security. It’s just as simple as that. And
                        you don’t want to be in a position of the United States itself being
                        responsible for providing that security for an indefinite period of
                        time.</p>
                    <p>I advocated the same in regard to Afghanistan, right after we went into
                        Afghanistan. But there again, we were late to start that. And it’s, I’d say,
                        only in the last couple of years that we’ve gotten really serious about it.
                        But to the extent that we get involved in these kinds of situations, it
                        seems to me that a lot more thought, effort, and resources has got to be
                        devoted to building local capabilities.</p>
                    <p>Certainly, another point is the question – and it’s really, again, about the
                        question of looking before you leap, be careful before you take the first
                        step, thinking of other ways to apply United States power and influence,
                        whether it’s through what I just talked about, the training of local forces,
                        covert action, if you will, sometimes may be an answer. Working through the
                        United Nations, I mean, the UN gets a bum rap in this country, and we pay 26
                        cents on the dollar to support UN peacekeeping forces. And I can give you
                        specific examples of where they’ve been successful in helping restore peace
                        and tranquility to various situations. Sierra Leone, to mention only one,
                        which was a basket case in 2001 and where the government’s writ extended
                        just a few miles within the capital of that country. And three, four years
                        later, the writ of the government extended back throughout the entirety of
                        Sierra Leone. And in large measure, that was due to a UN peacekeeping
                        operation.</p>
                    <p>But we have – whether we’re Democrats or Republicans, it doesn’t matter – we
                        have a mindset that says, oh, they can’t possibly do it as well as we do.
                        Well, that’s probably true, but they might be able to do it well enough. And
                        secondly, they will certainly be able to do it at considerably less cost in
                        blood and treasure to the people and Government of the United States. So I,
                        for one – I feel like I’ve always been a little bit of a voice in the
                        wilderness on this, but I think that we ought to devote more effort on the
                        part of our government, including our military, to thinking about how can we
                        make UN peacekeeping efforts more effective. How can we can we give them
                        training and so forth that would help make them better? And I think we’ve
                        done some of that, but I think we could do a lot more.</p>
                    <p>The organization of the United States Government effort – now, you could get
                        totally lost in this subject for weeks on end if you wanted to, and I think
                        there are a couple of things I would say. First of all, nation building and
                        all of these activities are really very hard. And it’s not obvious that
                        someone from the United States or from the United Kingdom or from France or
                        from some other – some former colonial power can really go and help
                        countries establish good governance in Africa, Asia, Latin America, or
                        wherever. I think that the efforts to have influence have got to be very
                        carefully thought out and focused. And interestingly, we kind of reinvent
                        the wheel every time we go through one of these efforts. I’ve been through a
                        bunch of them now. I mean, it’s not only Vietnam. I mean, I’ve been to
                        Central America and Iraq. I’ve watched Afghanistan. And each one is kind of
                        sui generis in the way we’ve gone about it.</p>
                    <p>But I do have some thoughts on the way we organize here in Washington for
                        this kind of effort. And here’s one area where I think we were actually
                        better organized in Vietnam than we have been since, and that is in terms of
                        our A-I-D effort. I mean, A-I-D is today a shadow of its former self. It’s a
                        fraction the size it used to be. And if other U.S. Government agencies
                        wanted to give assistance in the good old days, so to speak, they basically
                        had to do it through A-I-D. And A-I-D was substantial. They had four or five
                        thousand people in Vietnam, maybe more. At one point in its heyday, A-I-D
                        had a total of 10- or 11,000 personnel, and today it’s really a fraction of
                        that. And what’s happened in lieu of the old A-I-D is that our assistance
                        effort across the government has been atomized, or it’s been subdivided so
                        that when – well, first we abolished the public safety program in A-I-D
                        because that was kind of a politically taboo thing back in the ‘60s and
                        ‘70s, so we stopped giving police assistance.</p>
                    <p>When the refugee crisis arose, the boat people came out of Vietnam, we
                        created a different bureau in the Department. We said, well, we didn’t – we
                        weren’t going to ask A-I-D to do this. We set up a refugee bureau, and that
                        was a couple of billion dollars a year right there. Then, during the Central
                        America conflict, we discovered that, well, maybe we do need to be able to
                        train people in law enforcement and those kinds of things after all, and so
                        we set up an international narcotics and law enforcement bureau in the
                        Department of State, and there goes another one or two billion a year. And
                        then in the Bush Administration, we created the Millennium Challenge
                        Account, which some of you have no doubt heard of or been involved with.
                        Plus we had special programs to assist the former Soviet Union, also not
                        under A-I-D. And then, of course, we’ve got this mass of monies that we’re
                        giving in the struggle against HIV-AIDS in Africa and elsewhere under the
                        PEPFAR program. So I’m just suggesting to you that maybe we’ve now atomized
                        our assistance efforts in such a way that it’s very hard to direct them
                        towards a strategic purpose.</p>
                    <p>Now, some people who maybe value development for development’s sake – and
                        there is a school of thought that would make that argument – well, it’s just
                        intrinsically a good thing to do – may not care about our inability to sort
                        of zero in with the whole range of our assistance efforts. But I actually
                        think this is one area where the American effort in Vietnam was probably –
                        worked better.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Service personnel system, I have to say a little bit about this,
                        since I was the Deputy Secretary of State. And I can’t quite remember which
                        year it was, but I believe it was 1965, where LBJ called up the State
                        Department or spoke to Mr. Rusk – I don’t know how he went about it, but he
                        said, “I want you to assign every entering class of the Foreign Service to
                        Vietnam.” And so there’s a whole generation of officers from that period. I
                        was already in Vietnam, but there was a whole generation just a few years
                        behind me that just came en masse to Vietnam and created a real generational
                        experience, if you will, for the Foreign Service, which carried forward and
                        had a lot of influence in sort of the personnel setup in this building for a
                        number of years after that. I mean, people who’d served in Vietnam, I think,
                        tended to generally do better for having gone out there. A number of people,
                        not many, a few quit the service rather than go to Vietnam. And I met one or
                        two during that period who really were desperately sad about having done
                        that and were trying to get back into the Service, and the Department didn’t
                        take them back in. And it created a certain amount of heartburn. But by and
                        large, I think it was a positive experience for this building and for the
                        Service.</p>
                    <p>I came up against this myself, both as Ambassador to Iraq and then as Deputy
                        Secretary of State. How do you get people, without ordering them to Iraq, to
                        serve in Iraq? And we, at least during my time, I don’t think we’ve done it
                        yet, we’ve never resorted to directed assignments. We managed to, through
                        cajoling, persuasion, what have you, we persuaded people to volunteer for
                        service in Iraq. And I was very proud of that record, although I think
                        people knew that I was also ready to order them to Iraq if I couldn’t get
                        enough volunteers. And maybe the credibility of my own service in Vietnam
                        and the fact that I’d been ambassador and volunteered from my position as
                        ambassador to the United Nations to be ambassador to Iraq gave me a little
                        added credibility with the system.</p>
                    <p>And Vietnam influenced me a great deal on the value of reporting. I’d been a
                        provincial reporter. That’s the job I had when I first got to Saigon. I
                        covered six provinces, was basically coastal II Corps. There was group of
                        seven – six or seven of us in the political section. We divided up the
                        country. It had 42 – South Vietnam had 42 provinces and we each covered six
                        or seven of them. We’d go out one week, do our reports, come back, spend the
                        next week in Saigon, write up our reports and so forth, a lot of them by not
                        even telegrams in those days. Sometimes, we wrote what were called airgrams.
                        They were airmailed messages that I don’t think exist anymore, and haven’t
                        for years in the Department of State. And I wrote lots and lots of those. I
                        wrote a whole series documenting the decline in security at Coastal II
                        Corps, particularly in Binh Dinh and in Phu Yen provinces, because it was a
                        very desperate situation then, in the fall of 1964 and the beginning of
                        1965. I mean, the first North Vietnamese units had come into the country in
                        the summer of 1964.</p>
                    <p>I don’t know if it’s been raised at this meeting or at others, but John
                        Helble was our consul in Hue in 1964, and the consulate had the authority to
                        report directly to Washington in those days, and it would send its copies of
                        its telegrams to Saigon. And in June or July – I think it was July – of ’64,
                        John reported that the 1st ARVN division had captured a couple of enlisted
                        men from a North Vietnamese army unit. I mean, identified the unit and so
                        forth. And he sent that to Washington with a copy to us, and we all came in
                        the morning and we read our telegraphic traffic and said wow, look at this.
                        And it might not come as an entire surprise to you that Washington’s
                        reaction to that message was to take John Helble’s authority to report
                        directly to Washington away from him – (laughter) – and that henceforth, any
                        such explosive news needed to be coursed through the embassy in Saigon,
                        which in turn would decide whether or not to pass it on to Washington.</p>
                    <p>It was a particularly delicate time because it was a political campaign and
                        we had been informally told by some people close to the White House that Mr.
                        Johnson really didn’t particularly care for any Vietnam surprises during the
                        summer and autumn of 1964. Interesting in a way because things changed
                        rather dramatically the minute he got elected, and our approach to Vietnam
                        took a very, very different course.</p>
                    <p>But I felt from my provincial reporting experience that it was really
                        invaluable, and I think it’s still an invaluable function of diplomacy to
                        have people on the ground who know the language, know the area, develop
                        contacts, get that feel for a local situation that you can only do through
                        being physically present. And I always told ambassadors when they went off
                        to assignments, I told entering classes of the Foreign Service – I see I’m
                        really burning up my time here; I’m sorry – that one of the great value-adds
                        of the Foreign Service is our knowledge, our language and area expertise
                        abroad. And when I attended National Security Council meetings as director
                        of National Intelligence and I looked around the table, apart from our
                        military colleagues, who always have had some high-ranking military
                        colleagues have always had some overseas experience – apart from them, I
                        usually was the only other person at the table who had lived abroad. So this
                        is an important perspective that people who work in this building and in our
                        embassies and consulates around the world can bring to the table.</p>
                    <p>I guess I’d better stop there just to allow a little bit of time for
                        questions. Ed, I’m sorry I went on too long.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR BRYNN:</hi> No, that’s great. Thank you very
                        much. That’s great. (Applause.)</p>
                    <p>We have time for a few questions, and we’ll follow the format that we did
                        yesterday. I think we have people with the microphones on the side. If
                        you’ll raise your hand, our good people will get the microphone to you.
                        Let’s start. We have about 10 minutes.</p>
                    <p>Okay.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Yes, Ambassador Negroponte, you’re quoted,
                        or at least it’s often said that you’re quoted in a Tad Szulc argument – or
                        article about the Vietnam Paris peace talks as having said about the
                        Christmas bombing that we bombed them into accepting our concessions. I’m
                        wondering if you would talk briefly about your role in the Paris peace talks
                        –</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE:</hi> I did say that, by the way.
                        (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Okay – if you want to talk about your role
                        in the Paris peace talks and whether you agreed with Secretary of State
                        Kissinger’s comment about the decent interval or about whether, in fact,
                        there was an opportunity to make the Paris agreement actually effective.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE:</hi> Well, first of all, yes, I did
                        say what you – you asked me what my role was. Well, I was, of course, the
                        director for Vietnam for the National Security Council, and in that capacity
                        I got to travel around with Dr. Kissinger. I think I took something like 25
                        trips to Paris in 1972 and went to Beijing with him, I went to Moscow a
                        couple of times, attended – the Vietnam question was so predominant in our
                        foreign policy that a president and a national security advisor had to
                        travel around with their Vietnam expert wherever they went. It got me into
                        some fairly interesting meetings and situations. But my role was one of
                        supporting Dr. Kissinger. I was 30-something years old. I was 33, I guess. I
                        certainly was not his strategist and not a thought leader, if you will. I
                        was staff and so I don’t think I had – I didn’t really have much input into
                        strategy. I did not share – definitely did not share that feeling that Dr.
                        Kissinger was talking about yesterday on October 8th, 1972, when Le Duc Tho
                        presented his draft on ending the war and restoring peace in Vietnam. I did
                        not believe that that was a particularly hopeful moment.</p>
                    <p>I think I read you a little bit of a precursor of that in this 1969 piece
                        that I had written three years earlier. And I was deeply uncomfortable about
                        where this was leading us. I was particularly bothered by the fact that we –
                        they’d done it to – this was the second time that Hanoi had done this to us,
                        presenting proposals in October of a presidential election year. By the way,
                        that’s another lesson learned. Try to avoid negotiating in October of an
                        election year – (laughter) – on behalf of the United States. I’m not
                        kidding. I mean, seriously, one ought to be careful. I mean, they knew what
                        they were doing. I mean, I think Le Duc Tho said something like, “You’re in
                        a hurry, aren’t you?” I mean – and we were. And instead of just saying,
                        well, this is very interesting – and I became pretty much a professional
                        negotiator after that, not on things like Vietnam; I became a fisheries
                        negotiator. For a while, I was the deputy assistant secretary for Oceans and
                        Fisheries. So I got some real on the job training on a subject obviously not
                        of earthshaking strategic importance, but it taught me a lot of lessons.</p>
                    <p>But certainly, one of them is when you get an important proposal, say, “Thank
                        you very much. I’ve got to take it home and show it to my – to everybody
                        else.” But we didn’t do that, and we negotiated over that – I think it was a
                        weekend; I can’t remember now – from the 8th to the 11th or 12th, and we
                        were in a big hurry. Mr. Kissinger had a scenario where he’d already worked
                        it out in his mind that we were going to go to Saigon and then we were going
                        to go to Hanoi on the 21st or so of October. And it was – the ceasefire was
                        for some strange reason going to go into effect about a day or two before
                        our election.</p>
                    <p>So I think just caution – you’ve got to take it back home and show it to
                        everybody. We didn’t really do that. And October 11th, 12th, we finish and
                        we conclude the text, and it really didn’t change that much then through all
                        its subsequent iterations. I mean, what we left with from Paris in the
                        morning of – or whatever time it was – October 11th or 12th, it took – to
                        take to Washington, is essentially the text we signed on January 23rd,
                        whatever that was, four or three months later. So, no, I didn’t – I was not
                        optimistic. And the thing was that Saigon never really got an input, and I
                        think that really caused us serious problems with the Government of South
                        Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR BRYNN:</hi> This should probably be the last
                        question. Who has the microphone? Okay.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> I’m very interested in your comments about
                        the need for language skills, and I’m wondering, were we noticeably better
                        at Vietnamese language in the late stages of the Vietnam War than we had
                        been in the early stages? And were we any better in Iraq when you were
                        ambassador to Iraq?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR NEGROPONTE:</hi> I think that first part – the
                        answer to the first part of your question is I believe we were noticeably
                        better. Maybe not in terms of high-level proficiency, but in terms of having
                        run a lot of people through some kind of rudimentary course in Vietnamese.
                        And I certainly met some people later on in my time who really spoke very
                        beautiful Vietnamese.</p>
                    <p>The answer to your question about Iraq is basically no, we were not any
                        better off at the beginning. We are now. I mean, now it’s a huge priority
                        for this Department and for the intelligence community to have a lot of
                        people – and that’s been plussed up by an order of magnitude, I believe. But
                        you know we need a constant reminder to keep up these skills, to invest in
                        these skills. And here’s the great professional deformity of the Department
                        of State, which is there’s a kind of a mindset normally that thinks, well,
                        you know, on the job training is the best training you can have. And so
                        unlike the military, we do not reserve a certain amount of space, if you
                        will, what we call the training float, so that you’ll say that at any given
                        time, say, 10 percent of my officers will be doing some kind of training. We
                        don’t do enough of that, and we need more of a budget to do it. And we’re
                        always having to sacrifice that to meet some more urgent, though not
                        necessarily more important, needs. So I think as we look forward in years
                        ahead, we’ve got to start thinking more, in terms of our personnel
                        development, like the military does. And I guess if I were to say it in one
                        word, it would be – two words, it would be training float.</p>
                    <p>Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p>

                        This is a gentleman who has seen every side of the American foreign policy
                        effort over an extraordinarily long period of time. I was really impressed
                        by the prescient documents that he put together at the Hoover Institution. I
                        was at the same time laboring in “history corner,” which was just a few
                        blocks – a few feet away. And I do have to remind him that, remember, he was
                        at Leland Stanford Junior University, and I’ve been often asked, what is the
                        difference between a junior university and a regular university? And you
                        probably have been asked that, too. Thank you very much, sir. That was
                        great. (Applause.)</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR BRYNN:</hi> Dr. Carland, when he – he’s going
                        to come up and offer some words of discipline. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. CARLAND:</hi> Actually, I’m going to call Erin Mahan’s
                        panel to the fore and they’re going to be very disciplined.</p>
                    <p>While the panel is assembling, I call your attention to the title of the
                        panel, “With Friends Like These,” which was suggested by Professor Logevall.
                        So I want you to know he gets credit or blame.</p>
                    <p>Thank you. It was quite a treat to hear Deputy Negroponte talk about the four
                        decades plus of his career and how Vietnam started part of his career and
                        influenced him as time went on. For the rest of the day, we’re going to be
                        listening to and hearing from scholars who have done – who are doing new
                        research, groundbreaking research, on the way we look at and understand the
                        role of the United States and the history of its policy in the Vietnam
                        War.</p>
                    <p>The chairman of this panel is Dr. Erin Mahan. She’s Chief Historian at the
                        Office of the Secretary of Defense. She is also author of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Kennedy, de Gaulle, and Western Europe</hi>. Earlier, she was at this
                        office. She was chief of the Division of Arms Control, Asia, and Africa,
                        where she edited several volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> series. Thus, Erin is an old friend and one we welcome
                        back with affection.</p>
                    <p>Now, I will return – turn it over to you to introduce and exercise
                        discipline. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. MAHAN:</hi> If only I had been able to exercise that
                        discipline when I was the division chief for John and others and had those
                        FRUS volumes out a few years before now. But that said, it is indeed a
                        pleasure to return to the Department. And as John pointed out, I did work
                        closely on the last three Vietnam volumes before my departure in 2008.</p>
                    <p>But as I sat in the audience yesterday and today, I am reminded that there
                        are really two valuable vantage points that help us understand the major
                        events of the Vietnam War and the policy decisions that helped shape them.
                        One can be provided by those who were deeply involved and close up, Dr.
                        Kissinger in the making of Vietnam War policy, and those young, on-the-scene
                        Vietnam roommates, John Negroponte and Richard Holbrooke.</p>
                    <p>The other valuable vantage point, though, is provided by those who have the
                        advantage and the benefit of distance and time, the historians. And we’re
                        fortunate this morning to have three distinguished historians who write from
                        the wider international context by using multinational archival sources.</p>
                    <p>Our first speaker, Edward Miller, is a professor of history at
                        DartmouthCollege. He is currently completing a book on the early years of
                        the United States alliance with South Vietnam. This book is based on
                        extensive research in archival collections in the United States, but also in
                        France and Vietnam. His work has previously appeared in the <hi
                            rend="italic">Journal of Southeast Asian Studies</hi> and the <hi
                            rend="italic">Journal of Vietnamese Studies</hi>. He received his Ph.D.
                        in History in 2004 from Harvard University, and he will speak to us this
                        morning about “A House Divided: Nhu and the Can Lao Party and the Internal
                        Politics of the Diem Regime, 1954 to 1960.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. Miller.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. MILLER:</hi> Thanks, Erin. I’ll lend my voice to the
                        chorus of thanks to John Carland and the Historian’s Office for organizing
                        this conference. It’s a particular honor to begin the pointy-headed portion
                        of the conference this morning.</p>
                    <p>My topic today is one of the most famous and infamous political parties in
                        modern Vietnamese history. The official name of this party was the Can Lao
                        Nhan vi Cach Mang Dang. The official English translation was The
                        Revolutionary Personalist Labor Party. But to both Vietnamese and
                        non-Vietnamese, it was known simply as the Can Lao Party. The Can Lao was a
                        key part of the security apparatus of the Ngo Dinh Diem government in South
                        Vietnam between 1954 and 1963. Eligibility to join the party was based on
                        loyalty to Diem and to the Ngo family. The existence of the Can Lao was
                        officially acknowledged, but most of its members kept their affiliation
                        secret, in large part because Can Lao members served as informants for the
                        regime throughout the Vietnamese state, army, and other institutions. The
                        party also had other functions. It promoted the official ideology of the
                        Diem government, known as personalism, controlled a network of business
                        interests. It carried out a variety of covert political and intelligence
                        missions.</p>
                    <p>Now, all of this has long been known and acknowledged in the scholarship on
                        the Vietnam War and on the Diem period. However, to date, historians have
                        not made much of an effort to actually investigate the party and to kind of
                        peel back the layers of secrecy in which it was shrouded. So this paper is a
                        preliminary attempt to do that. In trying to do this, I’ve made use some
                        American materials, including some documents in the <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> volumes. Especially the Vietnam Volume for 1958-1960 has a
                        lot of interesting documents, revealing documents, about the Can Lao and its
                        organization. In addition, there are some very valuable recently
                        declassified materials. Thomas Ahern, a CIA historian, published a study of
                        the agency’s relationship with the Ngo brothers. It’s called <hi
                            rend="italic">CIA and the House of Ngo</hi>. That is available for free
                        download on the CIA’s FOIA website. It was declassified about a year ago. So
                        I’ve drawn on that.</p>
                    <p>But as Erin indicated, I’ve also drawn on other non-American sources. There
                        are a lot of French sources in the French military and diplomatic archives
                        on the Can Lao. The French actually maintained a very good intelligence
                        network in South Vietnam after 1954. I’ve also made use of a lot of
                        Vietnamese materials, including the memoirs of former members of the Can
                        Lao. And as Erin said, this is extracted from a larger book project that I’m
                        working on in the entire history of the Diem government.</p>
                    <p>As far as what I’m going to talk about today, I’m going to really briefly
                        talk about the origins of the party in the late ’40s and early ’50s, and
                        then I’m going to focus on the period from 1954 to 1960, what you might
                        think of as the formative years of the Can Lao.</p>
                    <p>Does everyone have the handout? There is – I printed out – okay, great.</p>
                    <p>About the origins of the Can Lao, it’s sometimes suggested that the Can Lao
                        was the creation of the CIA or some other U.S. Government agency. This
                        simply isn’t true. The Can Lao emerged out of the political activities of
                        Ngo Dinh Nhu during the late ’40s and early 1950s. During this time, Diem
                        was not in Vietnam. He was in exile, self-imposed exile in the U.S. and
                        Europe. Nhu, however, his younger brother, remained behind in Vietnam and
                        undertook various activities on his behalf. One activity that Nhu was
                        engaged in was the establishment of a group in the highlands town of Da Lat
                        in southern Vietnam around 1949. This group basically started off as a
                        philosophy seminar, and the large picture on one side of the handout is a
                        picture of that group. In that picture, you’ll see Ngo Dinh Nhu. You’ll also
                        see a French priest by the name of Father Ferdinand Parrell. Parrell and Nhu
                        were both very interested in the philosophical doctrine of personalism that
                        was associated with, among other people, a French philosopher by the name of
                        Emmanuel Mounier. And personalism would subsequently become the official
                        doctrine not only of the Can Lao Party but also the Diem government.</p>
                    <p>Now, those of you who know something about the history of the Diem government
                        know that personalism was known as something very abstruse, very hard to
                        understand. But that doesn't mean it was meaningless or gibberish. I think
                        that personalism did mean something to Diem and to Nhu and to members of
                        their close circle, and therefore it’s significant.</p>
                    <p>On the one hand, personalism was very anti-communist. It was very critical of
                        Marxist collectivism. But it was also very critical of liberalism,
                        especially liberal individualism. And so Mounier’s efforts in constructing
                        this doctrine of personalism was basically an attempt to split the
                        difference, to try to find some sort of middle ground, a communitarian
                        ideal. The problem was translating that notion of a middle ground or a third
                        way into a positive program of action. This was the thing that the Diem
                        government consistently had trouble doing. Nevertheless, personalism is
                        important for understanding, I think, especially the thinking of Ngo Dinh
                        Nhu during this early period.</p>
                    <p>In addition to this philosophizing, Nhu was also very busy in the early ’50s
                        networking. He and Father Parrell eventually expanded this seminar into an
                        Indochina-wide operation. They held a series of larger events, public events
                        in Hanoi and Saigon and other cities, and these events attracted the
                        attention of a lot of prominent Vietnamese anticommunists. And Nhu
                        subsequently forged relationships with many of these anticommunists and was
                        able to recruit several of them into the Can Lao.</p>
                    <p>The organization that became the Can Lao wasn’t actually formed until 1953.
                        And at the time it first emerged, it was really just a loose coalition.
                        There were intellectuals, political activists, a few military officers in
                        the Vietnamese National Army. There were a lot of Catholics in the Can Lao
                        at this time, but there were actually a lot of prominent non-Catholics as
                        well. And one of the interesting things about the Can Lao is it becomes
                        relatively more Catholic after 1954.</p>
                    <p>This was the situation, then, in the spring of 1954 when the CIA became
                        involved in the Can Lao for the first time. The CIA’s Saigon station had
                        been in contact with Ngo Dinh Nhu since 1951, but at first the station
                        viewed Nhu mainly as just a source of information about the Saigon political
                        scene. It’s only in the spring of 1954, just before Ngo Dinh Diem takes
                        power as the leader of what becomes South Vietnam, that the station proposes
                        to upgrade its relationship with Nhu. The key figure here was an individual
                        station officer by the name of Paul Harwood, who was the head of the covert
                        action branch. Harwood found out about the Can Lao from Nhu and he proposed
                        to help him turn it into a covert political action operation. And this began
                        a long period of CIA involvement with the Can Lao and affiliated
                        organizations that really lasted, off and on, until the early 1960s.</p>
                    <p>One of the reasons that the CIA decided to get involved in the Can Lao is
                        that at this moment, Nhu was preparing to reorganize the party to make it
                        more structured and into a more powerful political tool. And what he did is
                        he created three new organizations associated with the Can Lao. So I want to
                        just briefly talk about those organizations and their leadership.</p>
                    <p>The first of these, some of you may be familiar with, was something called
                        the National Revolutionary Movement. The NRM was an overt political
                        organization; that is, it operated openly. It was a mass mobilization
                        organization. It was supposed to be the vehicle that the regime could use to
                        enlist ordinary Vietnamese to support it. The NRM used various propaganda
                        and psychological techniques to do this, organized a lot of pro-regime
                        rallies, speeches, indoctrination sessions. And it eventually built a
                        network all the way into the countryside down to the village level. The NRM
                        played a key role in something called the Denounce Communism Campaign, which
                        was a major mass mobilization campaign launched in 1955.</p>
                    <p>Now, ostensibly, the NRM was an independent political party, but in reality,
                        it was controlled by high-ranking Can Lao members and it was really a Can
                        Lao front organization. The key figure in the NRM in these years was a
                        fellow by the name of <hi rend="italic">Tran Chanh Thanh.</hi> And if you
                        look on the reverse of the handout, you’ll see a picture of him there. Tin
                        was both the chairman of the National Revolutionary Movement and the Diem
                        regime’s minister of information. So he was basically the regime’s top
                        propagandist during its early years. Like the Ngo brothers, he was from
                        Central Vietnam. Interestingly enough, he was not a Catholic. Another
                        interesting thing about Tin is that he was a former Viet Minh official. He
                        had joined the Viet Minh in 1945. He actually served for a few years as an
                        official in Ho Chi Minh’s government before becoming disillusioned. He
                        eventually finds himself in Saigon in the early ’50s and that’s where he
                        hooks up with Nhu and becomes a founding member of the Can Lao.</p>
                    <p>During 1955, ’56, Tin builds this extensive propaganda system in South
                        Vietnam, and in the process he becomes very powerful. A lot of reports in
                        Vietnam – South Vietnam in 1955 have Tin as the most powerful figure in
                        South Vietnam who is not a member of the Ngo family. So for a moment,
                        anyways, he becomes quite influential.</p>
                    <p>The second Can Lao-affiliated organization that Nhu set up in the first year
                        Diem was in office was something called the North-South Interregional
                        Headquarters. The Vietnamese name for this was Lien Ky Bo Nam Bac Viet,
                        which was simply shortened to Lien Ky. LienKy was very different from the
                        National Revolutionary Movement. For one thing, it was much smaller. It was
                        a secret organization. It consisted only of Can Lao members, and it was
                        given a number of responsibilities that had to do with the internal
                        operations of the party. The most important of these responsibilities was
                        fundraising. Starting in 1955, the Lien Ky begins to build a Can
                        Lao-controlled business network, and this would eventually grow into a
                        pretty substantial business empire, to the point that the Can Lao became
                        involved in many, if not most, of the major businesses and industries in
                        South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>The man chosen by Nhu to run the Lien Ky was Huynh Van Lang. A picture of him
                        also appears on the handout. He was very young. He was only about 26 years
                        old in 1955 but he had a few qualities that recommended him to Nhu. He was a
                        Catholic. He was from the Mekong Delta. He had an advanced degree in
                        economics. He was just back from foreign study abroad, so that appealed to
                        Nhu. He was not previously a member of the Can Lao. However, he had
                        participated in the Da Lat seminar. If you turn back to that picture of the
                        seminar, you look all the way on the left side of the picture, that
                        individual there is a young Huynh Van Lang. So he actually knew something
                        about personalism, which Nhu found appealing.</p>
                    <p>Lang is actually still alive. I interviewed him and – a couple of years ago.
                        He explained to me how he built this Lien Ky business network. I’m not going
                        to bore you with the gory details here, but basically, he had a job – he had
                        a day job as the head of the Office of Foreign Exchange, and he was able to
                        funnel some of the money that his office collected as fines for illegal
                        currency transactions. He was able to funnel some of this into the Lien Ky
                        operations. And in the process, he was able to build up this network of
                        businesses.</p>
                    <p>The last organization that Nhu set up in the mid-1950s under Can Lao auspices
                        was the rather innocuously named Bureau of Political and Social Research.
                        This organization was set up as an official South Vietnamese Government
                        agency, so it actually – again, it was not technically secret. It was an
                        open agency. Unlike other parts of the Can Lao, this agency was almost
                        always referred to by its French name, and specifically by its French
                        acronym, S-E-P-E S, pronounced “say-pay.” The official mission of SEPES was
                        vetting applicants for government jobs. But in reality, SEPES had a much
                        broader brief; it undertook a wide range of covert missions. It conducted
                        espionage and intelligence on North Vietnam, counterintelligence against
                        communist operatives in South Vietnam, surveillance of the Vietnamese state,
                        bureaucracy, and army, mostly conducted by SEPES. There was the vetting of
                        new members of the Can Lao, training and indoctrination, also various kinds
                        of fundraising – for example, the selling of import and export licenses. And
                        finally, SEPES also was involved in the arrest – investigation, arrest,
                        detention of suspected enemies of the regime, including a network of special
                        prisons.</p>
                    <p>The head of SEPES was an individual by the name of Dr. Tran Kim Tuyen. He was
                        widely known simply as Dr. Tuyen. He was a Catholic from North Vietnam. He
                        was a former seminarian. He had also studied medicine. He never actually
                        practiced as a doctor, but because he had studied medicine, everybody
                        referred to him as Dr. Tuyen. Physically, he was very small in stature. The
                        picture on the handout perhaps doesn’t quite do justice to him. Apparently,
                        he weighed less than a hundred pounds. But he cast a large shadow over the
                        South Vietnamese landscape. He was a very influential figure for a time.
                        During the first Indochina War, he became involved in anticommunist
                        intrigues in Catholic areas in North Vietnam. This was how he first met the
                        Ngo brothers. He was subsequently recruited by them in 1954 and then
                        appointed to head SEPES in 1955.</p>
                    <p>So that, in a nutshell, are three of the key Can Lao organizations set up by
                        Nhu. I want to make just two observations about them. First of all, it’s
                        important to recognize that these three organizations only operated in the
                        southern part of South Vietnam, that is the old Cochinchina, basically the
                        area around Saigon and the Mekong Delta. This is because the Central Vietnam
                        branch of the Can Lao was under Ngo Dinh Can, another of the Ngo brothers,
                        and more on that in a moment.</p>
                    <p>The other point to make here is that the CIA had relationships with all three
                        of these organizations. Starting with Paul Harwood and continuing under his
                        successors, the CIA provided funding and training to Tin and the National
                        Revolutionary Movement. They also provided support to Tran Kim Tuyen and
                        SEPES in part because they wanted to collaborate on intelligence collection
                        with SEPES. CIA also had a relationship with Huynh Van Lang. It appears that
                        this didn’t involve actual material support, but they definitely knew who he
                        was and were in contact with him.</p>
                    <p>So the CIA is definitely involved in the Can Lao. Despite this, the CIA does
                        not get what it wants out of Can Lao. And the history by Thomas Ahern that I
                        mentioned earlier really makes this quite clear. And the question that this
                        raises, of course, is why? Why doesn’t this work out the way the CIA wants
                        it to? The agency concluded that Nhu just had different priorities, that he
                        wasn’t really interested in collaborating with them. My own view is I don’t
                        think this is quite right. I think that, actually, U.S. officials and Ngo
                        Dinh Nhu were actually not that far apart on their goals for the Can Lao. I
                        think they both agreed that making the Can Lao into a covert political
                        action organization was a desirable goal. Building mass support for the
                        regime, that was a good thing as far as Nhu was concerned. In 1958 – this is
                        actually from a document in the first volume – Elbridge Dubrow, the American
                        ambassador to South Vietnam, said that he, quote, “has no objection to
                        having the Can Lao help run the country and coordinate discipline and
                        developments.”</p>
                    <p>So the problem here is not that the Americans are trying to promote
                        democratic ideals and Nhu is authoritarian. I think the problems had to do
                        with certain features of the Can Lao and the way in which Nhu set up the
                        party. And very briefly speaking, I think there were two general types of
                        problems with the Can Lao. One was ideological; the other set of problems
                        was organizational. Regarding the ideological problems, there’s no evidence
                        that this doctrine of personalism ever had abroad appeal in South Vietnam.
                        And as a matter of fact, there’s not really any evidence that anybody
                        outside of Diem and Nhu and a few other – a small handful of regime
                        supporters could actually understand what Nhu meant by personalism.</p>
                    <p>I haven’t found many actual Can Lao documents in the Saigon archives but,
                        however, one that I did find from 1960 was a training document on sort of
                        the basics of personalism. And it seemed to suggest that it was important
                        for the membership to get a refresher course on this because no one in the
                        organization really understood what its official philosophy was. So
                        ideologically, I think, this was a problem for the Can Lao.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these ideological problems, there were also organizational
                        issues. From the outset, the Can Lao was beset by factionalism. Different
                        parts of the party were in fierce and bitter competition with each other.
                        This factionalism was not an accidental phenomenon. It was, rather, a
                        function of the way in which Nhu set up the party. It’s sometimes suggested
                        that the Can Lao was organized according to Leninist principles. The idea
                        here is that Nhu, despite the fact he was an anticommunist, actually
                        borrowed Leninist organizing strategies. I don’t think this is correct. In a
                        Leninist party, you have ultimately a very centralized organization. The Can
                        Lao never had a politburo or a central committee. In many ways, Nhu did the
                        opposite. He set up these different organizations in ways that were
                        basically guaranteed to pit them against each other.</p>
                    <p>So these three organizations that I mentioned had very contentious
                        relationships almost from the beginning. For example, starting in about
                        1956, Jun Jiang Tin finds himself on the receiving end of a smear campaign,
                        which is ultimately traced back to Dr. Tuyen and SEPES. He gets criticized
                        in newspapers controlled by Tuyen. This touches off a fight that basically
                        lasts until 1960. As a result of this, Tin is ousted as head of the National
                        Revolutionary Movement. He manages to stay on as Information minister until
                        1960, but at that point he’s finally outmaneuvered by Tuyen and he is sent
                        to his new job as South Vietnamese ambassador to Tunisia, considerably less
                        glamorous than his former position.</p>
                    <p>Huynh Van Lang also has found himself in a fight with Dr. Tuyen. In 1958, Nhu
                        told Lang he was dissolving the Lien Ky. Lang does some digging and he
                        discovers that Nhu is responding to some complaints lodged against him by
                        Dr. Tuyen. So there was a lot contention here within these organizations set
                        up by Nhu.</p>
                    <p>On top of this, there was another major rivalry for control of the Can Lao,
                        which took place within the Ngo family. And here, the antagonists were Ngo
                        Dinh Nhu on the one hand and the other brother I mentioned earlier, Ngo Dinh
                        Can. Since 1954, as I mentioned, the party had had this geographical
                        division of power. Nhu ran the south and and Ngo Dinh Can was supreme in the
                        center. At first, Can was okay with just running Central Vietnam, but about
                        1957 he starts muscling in on Nhu’s territory. He sends his loyalists as
                        province chiefs to take over provinces in the Mekong Delta. He also expanded
                        his covert apparatus in the south. He sends his own agents to Saigon and
                        they start actually competing and clashing with some of Nhu’s men. Several
                        members of Huynh Van Lang group are arrested, jailed for several months for
                        a pro-Ngo Dinh Can province chief, and Jun Kim Tuyen and SEPES actually have
                        to pull back their organization, their operations to kind of make room for
                        Can.</p>
                    <p>Now, in the long run, this bid by Can to take sole control of the Can Lao did
                        not succeed. In about 1960, Can’s influence falls off very precipitously and
                        Nhu makes a big comeback. And this is very important for the subsequent
                        history of the Diem regime because Nhu is very influential, really a
                        dominant figure in the regime from 1960 on. I’m not going to go into the
                        reasons for this comeback. If we want to explore it in the q-and-a, we can
                        certainly do that. But suffice it to say that the long-term effects of this
                        are very significant for the Diem regime. These rivalries among the Ngo
                        brothers will continue to affect the regime all the way down to its downfall
                        in 1963.</p>
                    <p>By way of conclusion, let me just make three points here. The first point is
                        that, as I indicated, the Can Lao was a profoundly factionalized
                        organization. And this has big implications for how we understand South
                        Vietnamese politics during the Diem period. Contrary to the popular view,
                        the Can Lao was not this super-centralized Leninist party. There was these
                        divisions among Can Lao organizations set up by Nhu. And then on top of
                        that, there was this rivalry between Nhu and Can.</p>
                    <p>The second point here is that the dealings of the Central Intelligence Agency
                        with the Can Lao need to be understood in light of this factionalism. The
                        CIA was definitely aware of these contests within the Can Lao, but they seem
                        to have been very slow to understand how these rivalries were affecting and
                        undermining their ambitions for the party.</p>
                    <p>The last and in some ways the most important point has to do with the
                        long-term implications for the history of the Diem regime from these
                        findings about the Can Lao. In this paper, I don’t discuss 1963 and the
                        events leading to the downfall of the Diem regime, but I will here give you
                        just one interesting factoid about that period. In 1963, as I’m sure you all
                        know, there was a big crisis in South Vietnam and there was a great deal of
                        coup plotting going on against the Diem regime. There were three coup plots
                        in progress in the fall of ’63 that were deemed to be particularly
                        substantial or serious. The first plot, of course, is the one that
                        succeeded. This was led by top generals in the South Vietnamese army. The
                        ringleaders of this plot were generals like Tan Van Don and Tran Van Minh.
                        They were not Can Lao members. However, in order for their plot to succeed,
                        they had to recruit military officers who were members of the Can Lao. And
                        the most important of these was a general by the name of Ton That Dinh, who
                        was the commander of the Saigon region. So that first plot did have an
                        important Can Lao element to it.</p>
                    <p>The other two plots that were in progress in the fall of 1963, one was led by
                        Huynh Van Lang, the former chief of the Lien Ky. And the other was headed by
                        none other than Dr. Tuyen, who by 1963 was completely on the outs with Nhu.
                        So I think what this suggests is that the Can Lao is really important in the
                        history of the Diem regime, but it’s important in a way – in a political way
                        which I don’t think we’ve quite understood yet, and hopefully, we’ll learn
                        more about as more research is done on this subject.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. PEDALIU:</hi> Hi. I, too, would like to thank John
                        Carland and everyone at the Office of the Historian for organizing this
                        intellectually – actually another one of these intellectually scintillating
                        conferences, and thank you for the kind invitation. Usually, I talk through
                        my papers. Today, I shall read it. Hopefully, that way I can keep to the
                        time. This is a severely pruned down version of the original one, so I still
                        hope it retains some coherence.</p>
                    <p>The Vietnam War, it influenced not only the United States, but also the
                        domestic stability, security, and wellbeing of its NATO allies in Europe. It
                        was at the height of the Gaullist challenge that President Johnson tried to
                        internationalize the conflict in Vietnam with the More Flags Initiative.
                        According to Fred Logevall, More Flags had been intended to strengthen
                        America’s hand both internationally and domestically, and thereby legitimize
                        the American intervention to prop up the wobbly regime in Saigon. Secretary
                        of State Dean Rusk took the campaign for More Flags to the North Atlantic
                        Council in The Hague in May 1964. He found all his NATO allies rather
                        circumspect on venturing beyond economic support to South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>The adoption of semantical [sic] strategies of containment had committed the
                        United States to a zero-sum game around the world that could not advance –
                        allow the advance of communism anywhere. In this respect, Vietnam was not
                        that much different than Greece had been in 1947. Unlike Greece, the United
                        States ended up committing troops to Vietnam and thus making it a test of
                        its credibility as an ally. However, to put things in perspective, the
                        United States was not the only country that was concerned about the
                        situation in Southeast Asia. Britain was involved there, trying to stem back
                        the Indonesian confrontation with Malaysia. And initially, the British
                        judged that the two situations did not differ that much.</p>
                    <p>It is true that the Europeans had initially encouraged American involvement
                        in Vietnam as a means of mitigating the volatility of decolonization and
                        containing any Soviet or Chinese advances. However, the Europeans, at this
                        point in time, they did not wish to see the expansion of the Americanization
                        of the war, nor did they wish to contribute militarily. The European allies
                        were appalled by de Gaulle’s behavior in using American discomfort in
                        Vietnam to score points in NATO, but they, too, believed that no Western
                        power could win this war.</p>
                    <p>Also, long-running, preexisting European dissatisfaction with the
                        consultation deficit existing within NATO merged with concerns over Vietnam.
                        For the European ex-colonial powers, attitudes towards Vietnam were also
                        shaped by – was shaped by a complex set of issues, including, to some
                        degree, bitterness over American past attitudes and behavior. These
                        governments were now pressed by the Third Worldism of the vociferous
                        European left and the disenchantment of the average European citizen over
                        the state of newly decolonized countries. This made it impossible to commit
                        conscripts to fight a war that was not considered intrinsic to their own
                        national security.</p>
                    <p>The NATO Europeans saw the central front as essential, and they were not
                        prepared to compromise the transatlantic bargain struck at the height of the
                        Korean War that Western Europe remained the key area for the defense of the
                        free world. To them, the strategic concept of the domino effect seemed
                        unlikely. France had left the Maghreb and North Africa had not gone
                        communist. By 1965, Indonesia had dealt with its internal challenges with
                        efficient brutality.</p>
                    <p>The Europeans also did not perceive China as a threat. However, there was
                        palpable concern in European capitals that the Americanization of the war
                        could spark off a Korean-style Chinese intervention. Manlio Brosio, the
                        Secretary General of NATO, thought it likely that NATO would be gravely
                        affected if Vietnam were to lead to a substantial reduction of American
                        forces in Europe. This was a major security concern. For example, the Low
                        and Nordic countries were worried that any decrease in American troops would
                        speed up the Soviet naval buildup in the North Sea. The NATO allies were to
                        see their fears of a drawdown of American troops materialize. By 1972, there
                        were 21 percent fewer American troops there than there had been in 1964.</p>
                    <p>Most Europeans laid the blame for the drift towards the Americanization of
                        the Vietnam War down to Flexible Response, which they saw as an open-ended
                        policy that diverted America away from the primary battleground in its
                        flanks. Thus Denmark and Norway opposed the multilateral nuclear force on
                        the grounds that it had the potential to upset the Nordic balance. The
                        European NATO allies felt that the – sorry – the dependability of the United
                        States was becoming less certain. The death of the MLF in December 1964 came
                        just too late to make good to the damage it had done to allied unity.</p>
                    <p>Less than a month after the announcement of the More Flags program in late
                        May 1964, President Johnson made his – one of his first allusions to
                        bridge-building with the Soviet Union. European capitals saw it as a sign
                        that the United States was diverting its attention away from Europe and also
                        a second détente at the worst possible terms. The Europeans did not want a
                        direct dialogue between the superpowers with allies excluded. Moreover, by
                        December 1964, they were convinced, according to British Foreign Office,
                        that South Vietnam was further than ever from victory, or in Konrad
                        Adenauer’s words, Vietnam was a disaster. The Johnson Administration was not
                        prepared to change its time scale, nor willing to take European advice.</p>
                    <p>By 1967, Vietnam had become a taboo in NATO meetings. The unleashing of
                        Rolling Thunder was felt deeply in Europe, too. But still, all European
                        governments, apart from France, stood by the United States diplomatically,
                        despite the huge political costs. European public opinion began to turn
                        firmly against the war. The Europeans saw just one solution to the impasse:
                        the end of the war through a compromised peace. However, rumors that the
                        collapse of Marigold, then Sunflower, had been intentional led many European
                        leaders, fairly or unfairly, to doubt the honesty of American actions. The
                        events of the Prague Spring in August 1968 were seen by the European allies
                        as an affirmation that the danger to world peace lay in Europe and not
                        Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>By 1967, a tumult of street protests signified a perceptible shift in
                        European electoral politics. Traditional systems of government came under
                        pressure from radical parties and demands for more inclusive politics. These
                        pressures stretched from the north, in the Low and Nordic countries, to the
                        south in Italy and Greece. In Greece, the democratic quarter was to collapse
                        from the insecurities détente had sown in rightwing and paramilitary
                        circles. In Italy, the war impacted on the cohesion of the faction-rivened
                        party, the ruling party, Democracia Christiana and compounded the general
                        political instability the country was experiencing.</p>
                    <p>In Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway, Vietnam intersected with
                        the profound change in how politics was practiced. In Great Britain, Sir
                        Michael Palliser wrote – an assistant, diplomat, and Wilson’s private
                        secretary – wrote in 1965, that the feeling against the War in Vietnam was
                        so strong that Labor regarded it as the most immoral act since the
                        Holocaust. So NATO itself came under the microscope of European public
                        opinion. Those against the war came to question not only their government’s
                        silence over Vietnam but also that of NATO’s, and also its toleration of
                        dictatorships within its ranks. In Denmark, this manifested itself in
                        pressure to hold a referendum in 1969 over the country’s continued
                        membership of NATO. In The Netherlands, a faction of the Labor Party
                        directly questioned the validity of the country’s continued membership.</p>
                    <p>The Americans realized the damage Vietnam was causing to the alliance. And
                        both Johnson – the Johnson and Nixon administrations, took active steps to
                        repair it. Johnson was to prove himself, as Tom Schwartz has shown beyond
                        any doubt, to be a consummate diplomat when it came to the protection of
                        NATO. By ignoring de Gaulle’s provocation in 1966, he showed up the French
                        leader to his fellow Europeans as the odd man out. And by introducing the
                        Nuclear Planning Group, he was able to repair some of the damage caused in
                        transatlantic relations. Johnson defended NATO against his American – its
                        American detractors and the Mansfield resolution. He too, like Kennedy
                        before him, refused to make Vietnam the litmus test of the loyalty of
                        America’s allies and did not allow the equilibrium reached with the Harmel
                        Report of a détente and the alliance’s future to be derailed by Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>NATO suffered during the years of Vietnam, but it did not unravel because the
                        European Economic Community countries all fell behind the Dutch Socialist
                        Foreign Minister Max van der Stoel, who said that the search for
                        European-based defense arrangements should not seek to replace NATO, which
                        would be absolutely irresponsible.</p>
                    <p>America felt lonely about Vietnam, according to a British Foreign Office
                        report. The reality was, however, that American great leaders offered up
                        support publicly, despite the political cost to them and their parties, a
                        position which they were able to maintain until 1971, when the Norwegian
                        Labor Party became the first one to break ranks.</p>
                    <p>All European NATO members tried to mitigate the lack of military support by
                        offering economic and development aid to South Vietnam. Britain offered up
                        the Thompson mission from 1961 to 1965 and counterinsurgency, military, and
                        police training in British jungle schools, infrastructural assistance, and
                        support. Germany offered direct financial support which, according to the
                        British, was impressive – medical support, loans, and technical assistance.
                        The Netherlands offered training facilities in Holland, and experts. Greece
                        offered military medical teams, pharmaceutical and surgical equipment.
                        Belgium and Turkey offered medicines. Denmark provided technical assistance,
                        medical supplies, and training for South Vietnamese nurses. De Gaulle had
                        clearly exaggerated when he claimed that Europe was paying for the war in
                        Vietnam, but as Zimmerman has shown, the Europeans shouldered some of the
                        costs of the war, especially in terms of monetary implications and currency
                        instability that developed as the Bretton Woods system collapsed under the
                        Nixon Administration.</p>
                    <p>Brosio and his successor, Luns, ensured that the issue of Vietnam was not
                        discussed by the allies unless the United States wanted it, and also that no
                        NATO communiqué was allowed to reflect the tensions within NATO over the
                        war. Perhaps all this support was not spontaneous enough and in sufficient
                        quantities for the United States to make the public statement it needed to
                        appease its own public opinion. Johnson’s fear that the United States would
                        be portrayed as a colonialist power if European NATO allies did not offer
                        visible support had been ill-judged.</p>
                    <p>How could the reintroduction of erstwhile colonial powers in a recently
                        decolonized region have helped to offer an aura for legitimacy or moral
                        crusade to the activities of a self-professed anti-colonialist power –
                        superpower? Even if it could have helped marginally with the United States
                        domestic public opinion, the negative effects in Europe would have been so
                        detrimental as to counteract any benefit. Europe could not help at this
                        time, and the United States would have not found itself in a more
                        comfortable place if it had. The problem had been South Vietnam and its
                        government. Had the European NATO allies said to the United States, in
                        Vietnam, the United States had lived up to its commitments, but there was no
                        limit – but there was a limit to what could be done if the other partner to
                        a commitment was unable to do its share and turned out to be not viable.</p>
                    <p>Instead of a conclusion, because I don’t have the time, I would like to wind
                        up this presentation with Dean Rusk’s word, which – who, in my opinion,
                        really described relations, the transatlantic relation at this time, at the
                        time of Vietnam, in an acute – an astute manner. He said, “The mood of
                        isolationism in the United States and Europe were feeding off each other.
                        People in the United States were turning away from Europe because Europe was
                        not helping in Vietnam. People in Europe were turning away from the United
                        States because they did not want to get involved there.”</p>
                    <p>Thank you. (Applause.)</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">DR. MAHAN:</hi> These papers are so interesting, I hate to
                        keep putting this slip of paper saying, “Please conclude, five minutes,” but
                        I guess that the DoD tradition. Thank you, Dr. Pedaliu, for your insightful
                        paper, which shows us that the impact of the Vietnam War was truly
                        global.</p>
                    <p>And our third and last paper should serve as a good complement to Ambassador
                        Tran and Dr. Ha’s presentations yesterday on North Viet – the North
                        Vietnamese war effort. Dr. Wiest has written a groundbreaking study on the
                        South Vietnamese military and the U.S. alliance with the Republic of
                        Vietnam. He’s a distinguished professor in the humanities and a professor of
                        history at the University of Southern Mississippi. He’s also the founding
                        director of the Center for the Study of War and Society.</p>
                    <p>In about – since 1992, Dr. Wiest has also been active in international
                        education and has developed an award-winning Vietnam study abroad program.
                        He will speak today about the South Vietnamese military effort and the U.S.
                        alliance with the Republic of Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wiest.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. WIEST:</hi> Like – excuse me – like everybody else,
                        I want to thank Dr. Carland and the Historian’s Office here. I get 15
                        minutes to talk about 10 years of research and a really fat book and all its
                        conclusions. I guess there’s no solution but to get after it, as we like to
                        say. I’ll apologize in advance, too, for my Mississippi accent. If you need
                        a translator, I guess the translator things will still work. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>I came to the study of the Vietnam War as an outsider. I was trained as a
                        historian of World War One and did a lot of my original research in World
                        War One and came to the study of Vietnam very accidentally by becoming close
                        to several veterans and taking those veterans to Vietnam on a study abroad
                        course. And while I was there in Vietnam in the year 2000, I ran into and
                        came to know several Vietnamese and got entranced by their side of their
                        war. I specifically got entranced by the South Vietnamese side of the war.
                        And when I came home, I began to think about it, began to research on it,
                        and found out that that side of the war is all too often ignored. Very
                        little is often written about it. And again, just as a historical outsider,
                        it seemed to me that that didn’t make much sense. It seemed to me, again as
                        an outsider, that this was their war to win or to lose, that American forces
                        were not going to be able to make strategic sustainability. That was up to
                        South Vietnam to do that. So it struck me that instead of ignoring it or
                        blaming South Vietnam, perhaps we ought to examine it a little more closely,
                        especially its military.</p>
                    <p>I discovered that the one major school of thought that existed really, and
                        then we’re beginning to – a number of historians are beginning to change
                        this, but the existing school of thought pretty much said that South Vietnam
                        and its military were so fatally flawed and weak that there was never any
                        hope, and why bother to study them at all? And certainly, when you look at
                        the South Vietnamese Government and the military, you discover a lot of the
                        basics. They were ham-fisted, they were often incompetent, they were often
                        saddled with graft, and they struggled to create any kind of sense of a true
                        nationalism.</p>
                    <p>The ARVN itself, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, was very often poorly
                        led and prone to very bad mistakes, if you follow some of its battle
                        histories. All these things are certainly well-known. But even as an
                        outsider beginning to familiarize myself with this topic, I noticed pretty
                        quickly that just on the surface of it, perhaps that initial idea that the
                        South Vietnamese state and government and its military were so badly flawed
                        that there’s no reason to look at it was perhaps wrong. South Vietnam fought
                        for every day of its existence from 1954 to 1975, never had a day at peace.
                        That’s an awful long war. The South Vietnamese suffered about 200,000
                        military deaths and a much greater number of that, civilian deaths. The war
                        was long and arduous, in fact more long and arduous than any war we’ve ever
                        faced. After the war was over, 1.5 million South Vietnamese fled. Hundreds
                        of thousands spent time in prison camps. Just as an outside observer, it
                        struck me that this is simply not the story of a nation that didn’t bother
                        to fight. These guys fought and seemingly fought hard.</p>
                    <p>So then, okay, I was brought to another question. Why didn’t they win? If
                        they fought hard, why didn’t they win? After all, they had us, the world’s
                        leading superpower, on their side. That seems to be a pretty good
                        combination. So in – what I wanted to look at was the alliance between us
                        and them and see why this alliance that seems very powerful on its surface
                        failed to achieve victory. And the reasons for that failure, if you delve
                        into them deeply, are really complex and have an awful lot to do with our
                        actions and their actions. It was an alliance failure; it wasn’t simply a
                        South Vietnamese failure.</p>
                    <p>To get into it more deeply, to begin to make some conclusions about it, I’ll
                        start off with some generalizations. First off, the South Vietnamese
                        military leadership and the leadership of the state was too tied to a
                        colonial past, it was too corrupt, and too incompetent to deserve the
                        sacrifice – first to get the sacrifice, and then to be deserving of the
                        ongoing sacrifice of its own people. That’s a bad card to play.</p>
                    <p>Second, our aid to this flawed system, while it was well-intentioned, was –
                        we had the effect of establishing a South Vietnamese military that was too
                        American in nature, a South Vietnamese military that had little connection
                        to South Vietnamese or Vietnamese social realities. We helped create an ARVN
                        around standard infantry divisions that relied on lavish logistic support,
                        the primacy of firepower and technology to achieve victory, all the things
                        the American military relies to achieve victory. And these are simply not
                        sustainable in a South Vietnamese system. If we’re there, they’re
                        sustainable; if we’re not, well, then the situation’s a little
                        different.</p>
                    <p>Our intervention in the war in1965, instead of fixing that problem, made it
                        worse. Essentially, what happened was that the U.S. forces came in, and
                        Ambassador Negroponte pointed this out this morning, instead of working with
                        the ARVN and help to make them sustainable, we shoved them to one side and
                        said we’ll win the war for you. Instead of making an ARVN capable of
                        surviving, we just pushed them aside and was going to do the war for them.
                        What this did was it marginalized the need for reform in the South
                        Vietnamese Government and the South Vietnamese military. Reform for them was
                        going to be painful and would take a long time. It turned out they didn’t
                        think they needed to. We would come along and save them, no matter how bad
                        they wound up becoming.</p>
                    <p>So the policy of the Americans before 1968 actually had – what we created was
                        an ARVN that really didn’t see the need for reform and was built to fight
                        alongside American forces, not to fight or survive on its own. It was only
                        after 1968, when the U.S. was a little more concerned about exiting the
                        conflict than creating an ARVN that was meant to survive, that we did put
                        some effort into that. But in my argument, it was too little, too late.</p>
                    <p>General Ngo Quang Truong, perhaps the best commander – field commander in the
                        ARVN, who commanded the ARVN 1st Division for most of my research, had the
                        following quote: “Entering the war with a posture and disposition of a fire
                        brigade, the Americans rushed around to save the Vietnamese house from
                        destruction but took too little interest in caring for the victims. Only
                        after they realized that the victims, too, should be made firefighters to
                        save their own houses did the Americans really set about caring for them.
                        Valuable time was lost. And by the time the victims could get on their own
                        feet and began to move forward a couple steps after recovery, the fire
                        brigade was recalled to the home station. It was too little, too late.”</p>
                    <p>My research also focuses on – well, it focuses basically on the lives of two
                        very important, I think, Vietnamese officers, a gentleman named Pham Van
                        Dinh and another gentleman named Tran Ngoc Hue. They both served, beginning
                        as – in 1961 for one and 1963 for the other, as platoon leaders. And by the
                        end of the war, one was a regimental commander and the other one was a
                        battalion commander. They both served in I Corps at the northern part of
                        South Vietnam. So looking at their lives, I’m able to see the tactical flow
                        of the American alliance at the combat level for pretty much the entire war,
                        making some more detailed conclusions by looking at their lives.</p>
                    <p>First off, from the very beginning, both men, like many of their American
                        advisors, thought that we and they were fighting the wrong war. They both
                        favored much more of a counterinsurgency type war, that they were left by
                        cold by idea of search-and-destroy, that they would move through an area,
                        defeat or run off whatever forces happened to be there and then leave, and
                        then leave the Viet Cong infrastructure in place to continue ruling that
                        area.</p>
                    <p>In 1967, Pham Van Dinh, the elder of my two soldiers that I focus on, was
                        made part of a very interesting experiment. His – he was a battalion
                        commander at the time. His battalion was made organic to a South Vietnamese
                        district, Huong Dien District, just north of the city of Hue. That meant it
                        slept with the people, it worked with the people, it became part of the
                        people, it helped with the harvest. It was made organic to the area. Within
                        six months, and this area was “overrun” – quote, unquote – by Viet Cong.
                        Within six months, the entire area had been pacified. In living with the
                        people, they were able to identify and eradicate the VC infrastructure. And
                        to put it bluntly, Viet Cong main force units avoided the area. They didn’t
                        want to tangle with a resident ARVN battalion.</p>
                    <p>So an area that had been Viet Cong-dominated goes to being pacified, and
                        really pacified, not the fake pacified that we’re often familiar with HES
                        reports, within six months. But after that six months was over, the
                        battalion was removed. It had taken too many boots away from
                        search-and-destroy. It was put back in a search-and-destroy mode. And then
                        one year later, this battalion is going to have to go back to Huong Dien
                        District with American Airborne and fight of the most bitter battles of the
                        entire war because this area once again goes into becoming hardcore VC.</p>
                    <p>Some other things that my research was able to point out: First off, I would
                        argue that much of our tactical history of the Vietnam War is simply wrong.
                        If you look at most of the great stories about great battles, whether they
                        be from the Ia Drang Valley on one end or even after we leave on the other,
                        you see American forces doing big things. And what’s usually missing from
                        the picture are the ARVN. They were there before we got there, they fought
                        in every major battle while we were there, and they fought in the ones after
                        we left, too. And usually, you can’t find them in any book. And I’ll just
                        use two examples, two examples that – of battles that my commanders fought
                        in and that they were central to.</p>
                    <p>If you pick up any book on the Tet Offensive in 1968 – and by the way, I
                        advise you to pick up Jim Willbanks’s book on the Tet Offensive in 1968. It
                        doesn’t have this problem. Most other books do. You see the American forces
                        specifically in HueCity, the city that almost all the way fell to NVA and VC
                        action. And you see a few brave American Marines, and there were a few brave
                        American Marines – all this stuff is true – defending the MACV compound and
                        then beginning a very slow, long struggle to retake the city in
                        house-to-house fighting. And that’s what you see, brave American Marines
                        doing what Marines have done through history. And they’ve done that – that
                        they certainly do this. The Marines free the city of Hue south of the
                        PerfumeRiver and losing 147 killed in the process.</p>
                    <p>But what’s missing is the ARVN. The ARVN was there fighting. Both of my guys
                        were there fighting. Tran Ngoc Hue led the Hoc Bao Company, a rapid reaction
                        force that did the most to defend the city. And then Tran Ngoc Hue led the
                        Second Battalion of the Third Regiment, which did much of the fighting to
                        retake the city. It was the ARVN that re-took most of the city, especially
                        the citadel. And just some small numbers for you: ARVN forces lost 357 dead
                        and inflicted 2,642 battle deaths on the NVA. And these are American
                        numbers, so probably not cooked South Vietnamese numbers. So the fighting in
                        Tet in the city of Hue isn’t simply an American battle, which most books
                        portray it as.</p>
                    <p>Another of the most – my most famous incident of this – excuse me, my
                        favorite, not most famous – incident of this in my book is Hamburger Hill,
                        which has kind of gone down as – in utter legend and even film in American
                        history. And the typical view of the battle is that the Third Battalion of
                        the 187th under its hard-charging commander, Tiger Honeycutt, fought up this
                        forlorn hillside for 10 days against really stiff NVA resistance, and right
                        as it was about to lose its last man, it broke through the final bunkers and
                        took the top of the hill. And yay, the movie can end with a celebration. The
                        truth of the matter is a little different. It was actually the Second
                        Battalion of the Third ARVN Division under Pham Van Dinh that reached the
                        top of the hill first. They advanced before the American units, they got
                        there before the American units, they radioed that they were up there, and
                        the Americans ordered them off. And they said if you don’t leave, we’re
                        going to shell you; this is an American battle to win, this is not your
                        battle to win.</p>
                    <p>And it took me a long time to actually prove that, to find the exact
                        documents for that, but that is proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. To me,
                        this incident points out a number of things about the American-ARVN
                        alliance, especially its fragility. What had they done? Exactly what we
                        asked them to, fight well in a battle. Show initiative. Achieve something
                        meaningful. And when they did that, our national or military psyche was so
                        fragile that we had to tell them that, no. And by the way, the ARVN noticed
                        very much, too, that they got no coverage after Tet, perhaps their biggest
                        victory ever in their history. And all they see in the American coverage of
                        this is the American coverage of Tet, nothing about South Vietnamese
                        victories. So I would argue we have to put the ARVN in the battlefield
                        histories to get the battles right.</p>
                    <p>Wow, five minutes. I like that. (Laughter.) I can talk real fast, as you can
                        already see.</p>
                    <p>My argument, then, would be that what we have here at this stage in the war
                        is the exact ARVN we were trying to create, an ARVN that fought well
                        alongside us, an ARVN that used American firepower and American logistics to
                        achieve its victories and achieve victories that we often don’t write about.
                        Of course, what happens then is we tend to – our histories of the war tend
                        to get even thinner because we tend to back out after ’69. American
                        consciousness about the war tends to fall. But South Vietnamese
                        consciousness about the war tends to really rise because they’re now in
                        trouble. Their two biggest battles, Operation Lam Son 719, the invasion of
                        Laos, and the Easter Offensive are post- most American consciousness of this
                        war.</p>
                    <p>And I think they’re very instructive to Operation Lam Son 719, the invasion
                        of Laos in 1971 is the first ARVN main force operation outside South
                        Vietnamese borders. It’s 17,000 ARVN soldiers against 60,000 NVA defenders.
                        Turns out the NVA didn’t run away like they had in Cambodia the year before
                        and like our planners hoped. They stood and fought. And the South Vietnamese
                        are cut to ribbons. Half of them are – half of the 17,000 that are put into
                        this are killed. And what you see is South Vietnamese junior officers, South
                        Vietnamese enlisted men, fighting very well and very hard. Tran Ngoc Hue was
                        a battalion commander in his own right at this time, commanding the Second
                        Battalion of the Second Regiment. And the story of his battalion is kind of
                        – well, it’s a little more than typical. His battalion was inserted at
                        Tchepone, all the way into Laos as far as we went, and had to fight its way
                        back out. It was surrounded six times and 26 people survived. These men
                        fought hard. The individual fighting man in South Vietnam was pretty good,
                        as were some – many of the low-level leaders. But if you look at the top
                        levels, everything fell apart. In fits of petulance, people complaining and
                        screaming at each other, the top-level command fell apart.</p>
                    <p>On the ground, the ARVN didn’t have its usual link to American firepower
                        because the American advisors didn’t go with them, so even that went awry.
                        So in – what do we see in Lam Son 719? An ARVN that’s capable of fighting
                        but an ARVN that is monumentally poorly led still. And you see the same
                        thing again in 1972 with the America – excuse me, the North Vietnamese
                        Easter Offensive. I have – this is when something very important happens to
                        Pham Van Dinh. He is defending Camp Carroll along the DMZ and his battered
                        remnants of his regiment are ensconced on Camp Carroll and they’re
                        surrounded by three NVA divisions. He radios back to his commander, his
                        corps commander, General Lam, and says, “Okay, I’m stuck here. What do I
                        do?” And Lam says, “Well, you fight to the end. And by the way, I have to
                        hang up now because I’m late for my afternoon tennis match.”</p>
                    <p>Dinh had, I think kind of rightfully for South Vietnamese officers, thought
                        there were two chances of victory: A) the U.S. would provide them a shield,
                        a military shield, and behind that shield the South Vietnamese Government
                        had to reform and make itself capable of survival. What he saw in 1972 was
                        the shield was gone. American ground forces didn’t play a role in this. And
                        he saw that the South Vietnamese Government in the person of General Lam
                        wasn’t worth his sacrifice. He saw that the war was going to end in a
                        different way than he’d hoped, and he surrenders and actually defects to the
                        North Vietnamese military.</p>
                    <p>In essence, what does the Easter Offensive then prove? I think it actually
                        goes on and proves, then, another counterpoint. The South Vietnamese, with
                        American aid, lavish American firepower, lavish American support with its
                        advisors – I’m sorry, they paved the North Vietnamese offensive. The North
                        Vietnamese offensive peters out at An Loc, peters out at HueCity, and then
                        the ARVN move back, taking back most of the land. ARVN is going to suffer
                        about 8,000 dead. The NVA are going to suffer, like, 40,000 dead. In
                        essence, what does this show? It shows that the American alliance with the
                        South Vietnamese was actually working as we defined it. With South
                        Vietnamese manpower and American firepower, we were tactically effective.
                        Tactically effective, not strategically.</p>
                    <p>And of course, what happens is the very next year, American firepower is
                        gone. And the year after that, American monetary support is gone. And the
                        South Vietnamese military is left in a situation it was never designed to be
                        in, a situation of being on its own. It was always meant to be an alliance
                        military fighting with us in a situation in which the enemy was, hopefully,
                        defeated and gone. The enemy is still there. The alliance partner’s gone.
                        And the South Vietnamese military is simply, in my view, not Vietnamese
                        enough to survive much longer.</p>
                    <p>So in conclusion, really quickly, I think that – what can we learn from just
                        looking at these two guys’ lives and taking thoughts from them? First off,
                        the South Vietnamese military is not just a parody. It perhaps is deserving
                        of some kind of historical inquiry. A second thing I think that’s perhaps
                        worth noting is that this South Vietnamese military finds itself at a really
                        uncomfortable confluence of events. It serves a South Vietnamese Government
                        that’s bad and that doesn’t see the need to change. It’s also serving an
                        American definition of a war, and America leaves that war and leaves the
                        South Vietnamese military in a very difficult place.</p>
                    <p>So is this the conclusion of history about the ARVN? No, I think it’s the
                        introduction. A lot more historical work needs to be done on the ARVN. And
                        despite bringing up these questions, perhaps that work will get started and
                        other people will take it forward.</p>
                    <p>Thank you. (Applause.) start here:</p>

                        chair’s prerogative to make a few comments, I shall refrain because we have
                        as our commentator of the panel a scholar who’s far more knowledgeable and
                        preeminent than I, and a very humble man and who’s shown me – I’ve observed
                        over the years the historians who submit the shortest bios are usually the
                        most accomplished in their field. So do not reflect – his bio does not
                        reflect everything he has done. He’s the author of numerous books and
                        articles on the struggle for Vietnam, and he’s currently completing a work
                        on the study of the First Indochina War and the roots of U.S. involvement. I
                        welcome Fred Logevall, who is a friend and will give you a superb summary
                        and tie these papers together.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. LOGEVALL:</hi> A superb commentary is what I now
                        have to give. I’m grateful to be here. I want to also extend my thanks to
                        organizers.</p>
                    <p>You know, I’m always conscious when I’ve attended a conference or I am
                        attending a conference on the Vietnam War, and I’ve attended a few, that I
                        have a kind of contradictory impulse during the conference. On the one hand,
                        I’m reminded of what the Victorian era novelist Lytton Strachey said about
                        the history of Victorian England. He said, “That history can never be
                        written. We know too much about it.” (Laughter.) And I have that feeling
                        when I’m here, but I also have the contradictory feeling, which is, man,
                        there is so much more that we need to learn about this conflict. There’s so
                        much new research that needs to be done.</p>
                    <p>And I’ve just finished – as Erin was saying, I’ve just finished writing a
                        history of the French war and then the transition from the French to the
                        Americans. And I’ve had even in writing that book, which I’m embarrassed to
                        say is a very long book, I’ve had those contradictory feelings. On the one
                        hand, there is just so much here, so much information, so much knowledge,
                        and yet there is so much more also that I’d like to know that I don’t
                        know.</p>
                    <p>What these papers remind us is that the United States, for all of its central
                        importance in the struggle for Vietnam after 1945 – and I do want to
                        underscore that central importance in my view of the United States from the
                        very beginning in 1945 right to end. For all of its importance in that
                        larger struggle, what these papers, I think, show is that the United States
                        nevertheless encountered demonstrations of the limits of its power and its
                        influence. Here we’re not talking about the DRV, we’re not talking about the
                        Viet Cong, the Pathet Lao, the Khmer Rouge. We’re not talking about the
                        Chinese or the Soviets. No, in fact, what we’re talking about in each case
                        in these papers, we’re talking about allies, we’re talking about partners
                        within South Vietnam and among Western – in this case, Western European
                        governments.</p>
                    <p>Now, I do think it’s important to note at the outset that in important
                        respects, the relationships in question worked, arguably worked remarkably
                        well, at least for a time. Thus, for example, in May 1957 when Ngo Dinh Diem
                        paid a triumphant visit to the United States, was even treated to tickertape
                        parade up Broadway, U.S. ties with the Diem regime appeared to many
                        observers to be succeeding marvelously well, though to be sure, as I examine
                        in this – in my current book, even at that point in the spring of 1957, the
                        bilateral relationship was in many respects beset by deep underlying
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>Likewise, with respect to American diplomacy with respect to Western Europe,
                        as Effie examines in her paper, one could argue that Americans did
                        surprisingly well by some measures, at least through the end of the 1960s.
                        I’ll come back to that in a moment. And the ARVN, which is the subject of
                        Andy Wiest’s paper, of course experienced tremendous expansion with major
                        American assistance and could point to achievements, as Andy has articulated
                        – incomplete achievements, fleeting in many respects, but nevertheless
                        real.</p>
                    <p>That said, a common theme in these papers, as I suggested a moment ago – a
                        common theme is that the United States did not at any point in the period
                        under discussion, at any point after 1954 – the United States did not have a
                        monopoly on agency. And I think that’s a point, by the way, that has
                        remarkable contemporary resonance with respect to our current two wars that
                        we’re engaged in today.</p>
                    <p>Henry Kissinger, yesterday when he was here, spoke about the limits, about
                        how Vietnam was from – was Americans’ first experience with the limits of
                        its power in foreign policy. I think that’s probably a debatable assertion.
                        One could argue, for example, that Korea demonstrated the limits for the
                        United States as well. But he’s certainly correct when we think about the
                        papers under discussion today.</p>
                    <p>Now, Ed Miller, in his paper, gives us welcome attention to the Can Lao, the
                        covert political apparatus, or really semi-covert, that was the Ngo family’s
                        main instrument of rule and whose members, many of them Catholics, held
                        principal posts in the government, in the bureaucracy, as well as in the
                        officer corps and police. And as Ed shows in the paper, the reach of the Can
                        Lao extended into virtually every facet of South Vietnamese political life.
                        And the paper makes several points, and I’ll just race through them briefly.
                        I’m conscious of our time and will cut some of the things I had prepared to
                        talk about here.</p>
                    <p>Some of the points that Ed makes here confirm my own sense of what was going
                        on at the time, but they’re nevertheless very important because he provides
                        corroborating evidence. Thus we learn, for example, that the Can Lao was
                        corrupt and repressive, that it was not created by or controlled by the CIA
                        or any other U.S. Government agency, that the party was in some respects Ngo
                        Dinh Nhu’s baby through and through. And Ed further shows that the Can Lao
                        was a key pillar of the Ngo family’s power in South Vietnam, but that it was
                        always – and he emphasizes this point, I think, quite well – always an
                        entity permeated by factional schisms, by careerist ambitions, by internal
                        disputes.</p>
                    <p>One of the things that would be interesting to have Ed talk about, if we have
                        any time this morning, would be to have Ed talk to us a little bit about
                        something that I think it will be a feature in his forthcoming book, namely
                        Nhu’s role in stoking the tensions in U.S.-South Vietnamese relations,
                        tensions that arguably were there from the very beginning in 1954 and
                        certainly were there to some extent from 1954, but increased later. As the
                        1950s drew to a close, American leverage with Diem, not high to begin with,
                        had declined further. Try as U.S. officials might to get him to broaden his
                        government, to show more sensitivity to the needs of his people, to show
                        greater tolerance for the expression of political opposition, they got
                        nowhere. Instead, Diem, his sense of idealism and his utter confidence in
                        his own political instincts wholly uimpaired, turned increasingly inward,
                        relying almost exclusively on an ever-shrinking circle of confidants, headed
                        by none other than, of course, Ngo Dinh Nhu, his brother.</p>
                    <p>And I’m interested in this – in Nhu’s role. He, like many of Vietnam’s
                        French-educated intellectuals, had contempt for the rich and brash
                        Anglo-Saxons, whom he considered dull and unsophisticated. He contemptuously
                        remarked to an ARVN officer at one point that while the French might have
                        been our colonial masters, but at least they understand Vietnam, whereas the
                        United States, quote, “helps us with a lot of money but doesn’t know
                        anything about Vietnamese affairs.” So I’d be interested in hearing Ed talk
                        a little bit of more that, if we have a chance. Now, more to be said there
                        but I’m going to skip ahead.</p>
                    <p>Effie’s paper is about, as you’ve heard, the U.S., its European allies, and
                        the Vietnam War. And from ’65 to ’74, she focuses in particular on the mid
                        1960s. And as she rightly notes in her introduction, the effects of the war
                        were global. This paper helps to show that. And she traces here how
                        America’s NATO allies in particular came to differ with Washington over the
                        war. I think she’s right to remind us that European governments, by and
                        large, were not hostile to American policy in Vietnam – possible exception
                        being the French. Most European leaders were sympathetic to what Washington
                        was trying to achieve in Vietnam, namely the preservation of an independent,
                        non-communist government in the South. They also shared with Washington a
                        desire to check possible Chinese expansion in the region. Nevertheless, as
                        Effie shows, these governments resisted what in many cases was strong and
                        persistent American pressure to become militarily involved.</p>
                    <p>And here are the reasons I think are interesting. Number one, these leaders
                        were skeptical that a lasting military victory could be achieved, especially
                        in view of the perceived weakness of the Saigon government and the apathy
                        and war-wariness of the Southern populous. Second – and maybe this a point
                        that Effie could have made somewhat more strongly – second, these Western
                        European officials also doubted that the outcome in Vietnam was actually of
                        central national security importance. The domino theory, as she notes, had
                        become moot to a great many Americans by the time you get into the early and
                        mid-1960s. Third, for these governments, there were also potential domestic
                        political implications and costs to be paid if you committed manpower to a
                        faraway struggle whose importance to their nation’s security was at best
                        open to question. That is to say, Vietnam was simply not worth the price of
                        a military commitment for these governments.</p>
                    <p>Now, just a quick point here. Washington, of course, proceeds with
                        escalation, even though its so-called More Flags program, More Flags
                        attempt, fails quite miserably. It proceeds with escalation anyway, as we
                        all know. And this, I think, is an important point because what it
                        demonstrates, among other things, is that these governments, despite their
                        misgivings, were by and large – Charles de Gaulle and Paris being the
                        exception – by and large unwilling to oppose Washington on the war, which
                        means, I think, that you can argue that American diplomacy in many respects
                        was actually remarkably successful on Vietnam in this respect. Washington
                        persuaded these leaders to keep their reservations private, which meant that
                        Lyndon Johnson and his aides could argue, inaccurately but with little fear
                        of protest, that the Vietnam War was a war fought on behalf of the free
                        world with the support of the free world. I’d be interested to know what
                        Effie makes of this argument.</p>
                    <p>I’m going to just say a quick word here about Andy’s paper, in the interest
                        of time. Of course, the focus is on ARVN, as we’ve just heard. And he argues
                        that only by understanding South Vietnam and by understanding the role in
                        this case of the military can we really begin to get a comprehensive
                        understanding of the war itself. The South Vietnamese army, he argues
                        strongly, must be a central part of the story. Now, he elaborates these
                        points, I think, quite well, and he gives particular attention, as you’ve
                        heard, to two junior officers.</p>
                    <p>He’s, I think, perhaps a little bit – and Andy can speak to this if he gets a
                        chance – uncertain about America’s ally in Vietnam and what it achieved and
                        what it didn’t achieve. I think this is understandable, particularly if this
                        is fairly early on in Andy’s research. He notes that the ARVN fought well,
                        with tenacity, on some occasions, but not other occasions. He says at
                        several points in the paper that it was too weak to stand on its own. He
                        writes the ARVN, quote, “was often poorly-led and mistake-prone. All of
                        these things are well known and go without saying.” Later on, he writes,
                        “The South Vietnamese military leadership was too tied to a colonial past,
                        too corrupt, too incompetent to deserve the ongoing sacrifice of its own
                        people.” So there’s a tension here that Andy, I hope, can work out or at
                        least further explain and would, I think, give the paper and the larger book
                        project a great deal of potential, because he’s certainly right that this is
                        a subject matter that we need to look at further.</p>
                    <p>I would just conclude with a note of skepticism, I guess, which is that we
                        see a pattern developing fairly early on in the conflict, which is that the
                        Viet Cong, like their Viet Minh forerunners, liked to operate at night and
                        in the bush. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam, with its formidable
                        U.S.-supplied firepower, was afraid of the night and the jungle, just as the
                        French Union forces had been. Virtually no ARVN officers had fought on the
                        side of the Viet Minh in the earlier struggle. Most, indeed, had served
                        under the French. A clear majority was from privileged backgrounds,
                        well-to-do, urban, disdainful of the peasantry that still made up the vast
                        bulk of the Vietnamese populous, real problems here that I think would be
                        interesting to explore further if we get a chance.</p>
                    <p>I had a concluding section which was going to deal with counterinsurgency,
                        and as Andy suggested, his two – the two junior officers that he focuses on
                        in particular argue that what the United States and the ARVN should have
                        done was paid more attention to counterinsurgency strategy, focused more on
                        counterinsurgency. I have real personal doubts about whether such a strategy
                        could have achieved, never mind the fact that the counterinsurgency is also
                        a very capacious term that can mean a great many things. Let it just be said
                        that I don’t think myself that had – thinking counterfactually, had in fact
                        the ARVN and the U.S. military adopted such a counterinsurgency strategy –
                        COIN, to use the current phrase – earlier, that it would have made an
                        appreciable difference in the end. David Elliott, I think, articulated my
                        basic position on this yesterday.</p>
                    <p>And so as we are at 11:26, and I apologize for this, I will conclude there
                        and just thank the presenters and thank all of you for paying attention.
                        Sorry. (Applause.)</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">DR. MAHAN:</hi> We do have a few minutes – can you hear
                        me? We do have a few minutes – questions. The one thing standing between you
                        and lunch are your own questions, so that can be a reminder to keep the form
                        of your question as an inquiry and not a long commentary. So with that, I
                        will – the microphones are ready and --</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Hi. Rufus Phillips. I think – and this is a
                        problem of how much detail do you get into. But as somebody who lived
                        through that ’54 into ’56 period, we made a lot of fundamental mistakes, and
                        we don’t get much of that coming out. I missed in Professor Miller’s the
                        question of whether there was any dispute on the American side about the
                        support that we gave to the Can Lao. There was. And the same thing on the
                        whole question of how we converted ARVN. We made the decision then to make
                        ARVN into a regular army, a copy of the U.S. Army, to prevent an invasion
                        across the 17th parallel.</p>
                    <p>So we start out, in my opinion, after some initial success, in the wrong
                        direction in a number of areas. And not only that, but when you talk about
                        giving advice to Diem, if your ambassador is completely antagonistic to
                        Diem, you ensure that that advice is not going to be given. So there’s a
                        personal side to how history works itself out that sometimes doesn’t come
                        through, and maybe we don’t have enough time for it. But I really would like
                        to ask Professor Miller to comment on the question of American backing for
                        the Can Lao, because there was – and there was another judgment idea there
                        that did not get taken into account.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. MILLER:</hi> You’re alluding to the opposition of
                        Edward Lansdale --</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. MILLER:</hi> -- to the idea of the CIA relationship
                        with the Can Lao. And, yeah, you’re absolutely correct. He did oppose it.
                        And this – on the American side, this is a function of the division between
                        Lansdale’s Saigon Military Mission, which you will remember, and the regular
                        CIA station, this very anomalous situation in Saigon in ’54 and ’55, where
                        we essentially had two CIA stations, and they did have very different ideas
                        about how to go about supporting this.</p>
                    <p>As you said, Lansdale loses that particular argument. So it’s an important
                        part of the story, but what I was trying to focus on here was the history of
                        the party as it unfolded and the regular CIA station, first under Harwood
                        and then continuing under some of his successors like Blaufarb and Colby.
                        So, yeah, there was more to it than I can put into a 20-minute presentation,
                        but that’s why you can buy the book when it comes out. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. WIEST:</hi> And if you want me to comment about the
                        military stuff at the beginning, when the Americans are advising the South
                        Vietnamese military more than they are anything else, there are some pretty
                        big arguments, with Diem often thinking that counterinsurgency following in
                        more of a Vietnamese type path would be the way to go, but that those
                        arguments do not win the day. The American pile of money that threatens to
                        keep coming is overwhelming.</p>
                    <p>And to – a very quick question of the commentator, was this stuff
                        sustainable? Could South Vietnam have won with this military not as it was
                        structured? So we got off to a wrong foot and had the wrong leaders. I think
                        that a big thing that would have changed that – had a younger cadre of
                        leadership represented by the two guys that I’m – that I write about that
                        only knew American support, not French support, only knew more modern types
                        of – it was – if you ask them and they say, well, three more years, that’s
                        what they all say. Three more years, we would have gotten old – Ngo Quang
                        Truong being the lead example. Here’s a nonpolitical general rising to
                        power, and they saw him as their great hope, and more people like him. But
                        it didn’t happen.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> I had a question up here. Lionel
                        Rosenblatt’s my name. I wondered in terms of Professor Wiest, your
                        commentary on ARVN, whether you had also looked at the wider array of GVN
                        programs. We’re going to talk about that this afternoon, I guess, on the
                        counterinsurgency side. I think that there is a chance that ARVN and these
                        other programs could have succeeded if the U.S. withdrawal had occurred more
                        rapidly, actually. Did the Vietnam Special Studies Group ever come up in
                        Kissinger’s presentation yesterday, the SSG?</p>
                    <p>I was a member of the group. I guess it’s unclassified today, but a group of
                        us went back in 1970 to assess conditions in the provinces in which we’d
                        served. And we concluded that ARVN could make it and the GVN could make it
                        with a certain short list of U.S. support items which, of course, were not
                        provided. But that ought to be a part of the history of our relationship
                        with the Vietnamese. A study was made by the White House under Kissinger’s
                        tutelage. We dealt directly with Abrams and the ambassador, of course. And
                        those recommendations are somewhere in the archives and ought to be looked
                        at. Thank you.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. WIEST:</hi> The study I did was actually fairly
                        narrow, so I didn’t have a chance to look at those. But the South Vietnamese
                        officers that I interviewed, and there were several of them, universally
                        said that Vietnamization should have started in around 1966, that the war
                        should have been more Vietnamese and less American, and that would have been
                        a positive plus for them.</p>

                        (Laughter.) Don’t be apologizing for your accent. It’s these people here

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> But thanks so much for your paper and
                        spelling out in some detail how well ARVN – some of the ARVN forces fought.
                        And I’m sure there were very good people in those units and supporting the
                        American effort. I knew a bunch in Vietnam – in Alaska, where I lived 14
                        years, very impressive people. Just overall, I just don’t – I question
                        whether or not on the South Vietnamese side there was anything comparable
                        that could stand up to what Ho Chi Minh, the Viet Minh, and the regular
                        units and all those people that put together this tremendous effort. It’s
                        just another version, a variation of Dr. Kissinger’s theme that, well, we
                        could have won the war but it all fell apart back here at home. And we do
                        have other Vietnamese people in the room, these folks that gave these
                        marvelous presentations. Is there time for any or one of them to just
                        comment very briefly on your paper?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. WIEST:</hi> And just really quickly, I do agree that
                        the South Vietnamese military as it’s structured is not going to survive,
                        and it doesn’t. It collapses in record speed. And another thing I would ask
                        you to do is check out Jim Willbanks’s book on An Loc, the siege there. The
                        South Vietnamese military is this wonderful eclectic mix of great units,
                        awful units, and units somewhere in the middle, some units that are easily
                        the match of American units, some units that can’t fight their way out of a
                        wet paper bag. And it usually comes down to leadership, who is physically
                        leading them, and that’s a real mixed bag in the ARVN. So it’s a very flawed
                        institution. But perhaps with a different beginning, as we get back to, it
                        could have been different, but it certainly wasn’t.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. PEDALIU:</hi> Thank you. Now, Fred, you are quite
                        right. The Americans were successful in keeping the Europeans on board
                        during this time. However, what is the point here is that the Europeans from
                        very early on expressed to the Americans their misgivings. And their fear
                        was that the Cold War could be lost in Europe because of the situation and
                        the popular unrest in Europe at this particular time.</p>
                    <p>The other thing is that there was a semantic difference when Americans and
                        Europeans talked about the free world at this particular time. The Europeans
                        are thinking of the West and the Americans are talking about the free world.
                        And that becomes more and more acute as the Vietnam War continues.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">DR. CARLAND:</hi> Good afternoon. We are reassembling for
                        the final drive. We can see – excuse me for saying this – what do you think
                        I’m going to say? (Laughter.) A light at the end of the tunnel. Yes,
                        indeed.</p>
                    <p>Is Stephen Morris in the crowd? Hmm, this may be interesting. We’re gathered
                        for another scholarly session. The chair of this session, which is titled
                        “Fighting While Negotiating: Force and Diplomacy in the Vietnam War,” is
                        Edward C. Keefer, Ted Keefer. He is currently a historian at the Department
                        of Defense, preparing a history of the Secretary of Defense Brown’s tour of
                        duty, 1977-1980. Prior to this assignment, Ted spent a mere 34 years at the
                        Office of the Historian at the Department of State, the last several years
                        as general editor. Ted’s long tenure at the office, and in particular the
                        work he did on <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volumes on the Vietnam War--I
                        think the number is 25, is that right, Ted? You were – okay, 25, at least. I
                        think this gives him – makes him the perfect chairman for a panel that
                        speaks to the complex topic of how force and diplomacy related to one
                        another in this wartime setting.</p>
                    <p>A personal note before I turn this over to Ted: Ted helped me a great deal to
                        learn my trade as a documentary editor. When our time at the – during our
                        time at the Historian’s Office, Ted and I had many talks about how to
                        document the history of the Vietnam War, how to do it better, and so on. We
                        also talked frequently about mounting a conference on the history of U.S.
                        policy in the war when we completed the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                            Relations</hi> series. Well, we have completed the series. We are now
                        having the conference. I hope Ted is pleased. And now I’m going to turn the
                        panel over to him. Ted?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. KEEFER:</hi> I’d like to add my thanks to John and the
                        staff at HO for this conference. But I’d like to give a special thanks to
                        John, not just for the two volumes exquisitely documented and selected on
                        Vietnam himself, but also for the last two years really being the <hi
                            rend="italic">de facto</hi> general editor of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Foreign Relations</hi> for the Vietnam volumes. These volumes that came
                        out would not have happened without John.</p>
                    <p>And then, as John pointed out, I worked in the Office of the Historian for 34
                        years and I basically started on Vietnam, and the Vietnam of 1955, when I –
                        it was my second assignment. And better late than never. And I am pleased to
                        say that my Vietnam experience is over with. It’s a major accomplishment for
                        the Department of State to produce the kind of volumes that we did, not just
                        on Vietnam. And one of the things that I wanted to emphasize when I was
                        working on Vietnam was that there was also a war going on in the rest of
                        Southeast Asia – in Laos, in Thailand, and Cambodia. So I think we have
                        really managed to cover the Vietnam War in its entirety, and I’m very
                        pleased. And I thank John for his effort and for all the other people who
                        worked on the volumes.</p>
                    <p>This today’s session is about, really, the essence of the Vietnam War, at
                        least under the strategy of the Vietnam War – grand strategy by the Nixon
                        Administration and by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and that is using
                        force and backing it up with diplomacy, or using diplomacy and backing it up
                        with force, however you want it, get it.</p>
                    <p>The first paper will be given by Harish Mehta, who did his undergraduate work
                        at the University of Lucknow in India. Then he got his PhD from McMaster
                        University. He was also a journalist for the <hi rend="italic">Straits
                            Times</hi>, a group of Singapore, and has traveled extensively in
                        Southeast Asia. And I think what makes his paper interesting and will make
                        it interesting is his work in Vietnamese and Southeast Asian archives. So I
                        would like to turn the session over to him.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. MEHTA:</hi> I’d like to thank Dr. Keefer for his
                        comments, for this forum, to have him introduce me. I also, before I start,
                        I’d like to thank, as everyone else has, Dr. John Carland and the Office of
                        the Historian for putting up this wonderful show and for – especially
                        inviting me to kind of – or rather, giving me the opportunity to come and
                        share things with all of you.</p>
                    <p>So before I actually start, I’d just like to kind of mention that this whole
                        idea of people’s diplomacy, especially from the Vietnamese perspective, is
                        probably a newish idea. It only goes back 50-odd years, but it’s fairly new
                        because it hasn’t really been talked about, especially in the historical
                        field. And before I get into the nitty-gritties of people’s diplomacy, I
                        only – the only thing I need to add is to just mention very briefly the
                        kinds of archives that I’ve looked at. And these are principally the Hanoi
                        archives, as well the LBJ Library in Austin, Texas, the National Security
                        Archive, and most importantly not to forget the Bertrand Russell Papers,
                        which are in my university back in Hamilton McMaster.</p>
                    <p>So the fact that people’s diplomacy is fairly new, and it’s only about 50-odd
                        years old, can only lead me to the conclusion that there are certain gaps in
                        the literature. And these gaps are pretty apparent because the whole process
                        of writing the history of the war has, as has been very well pointed out,
                        been dominated from a very Western point of view, almost an Anglo-American
                        perspective. The – but historians who have – who are kind of late in coming
                        into the field have begun to look at the whole idea of constructing a fuller
                        perspective on the – on what American history is or where it’s going. I
                        think these younger scholars are sort of seemingly taking it in a direction
                        where constructions of post-coloniality, and constructions of resistance,
                        and a deeper understanding of the kind of hegemonies the United States
                        employed and the kinds of resistance it faced. And unfortunately, while
                        resistance is very well talked about, we really haven’t explored archivally
                        the kinds of resistances that existed. There wasn’t one; that’s why I kind
                        of referred to it in the plural. So let me get into the paper very quickly
                        because I had to cut down a fairly detailed paper, trying to bring it down
                        to 10-odd pages.</p>
                    <p>So the Vietnamese revolutionary leader, Ho Chi Minh, formulated the concept
                        of people’s diplomacy during the war with the French, ’46 to ’54. And
                        starting in 1948, Ho Chi Minh actually begins to send small groups of North
                        Vietnamese mass organizations into France and China, believing that the
                        Vietnamese people will be more effective in establishing relationships with
                        people abroad, because as a fledgling state of the Democratic Republic of
                        Vietnam, the DRV lacked a properly organized diplomatic service. So it was
                        really the lack of a service that pushes people’s diplomacy. He uses people
                        where formal contacts don’t exist.</p>
                    <p>So in such circumstances, Ho Chi Minh actually leavened traditional DRV
                        diplomacy with a new ingredient, which was people’s diplomacy. And the North
                        Vietnamese actually begin promoting the cause of Vietnamese independence and
                        establishing enduring links with non-governmental entities and individuals
                        abroad. And people’s diplomacy quickly begins to play a kind of relatively
                        minor role at that point in time, because the main goal of the Vietnamese
                        revolutionaries until then was to achieve independence through military
                        means. Diplomacy was nonexistent with France. I mean, there were a series of
                        – it was existent, but it certainly didn’t go anywhere.</p>
                    <p>It was during the second Indochina war, with the United States, that the
                        leaders of North Vietnam created a diplomatic front, which was called (in
                        Vietnamese) to implement people’s diplomacy, (in Vietnamese). And both these
                        Vietnamese terms, I only refer to them only once in this paper, only to
                        highlight the fact that they’ve appeared repeatedly through party documents
                        as well as more recent works by Vietnamese historians and other scholars of
                        international relations.</p>
                    <p>So the idea of people’s diplomacy first comes up at the Second Congress of
                        the Vietnam Workers Party, which is the Lao Dong Party, in February of 1951.
                        At this event, 200 delegates representing 500,000 rank-and-file members of
                        the party attend the event in – at a small location in North Vietnam just
                        when the DRV is beginning mobilizing its forces to confront the French Far
                        Eastern expeditionary (inaudible) on the battlefield. The party admits at
                        the Second Congress that because the (inaudible) hadn’t fully understood the
                        concept of people’s diplomacy, the party had failed to develop an effective
                        and resolute plan to conduct this novel form of diplomacy. The Congress then
                        instructs that people’s diplomacy must be employed in order to tighten
                        connections between mass organizations in Vietnam and people’s organizations
                        abroad, and that people’s diplomats of Vietnam must participate in efforts
                        to mobilize popular support abroad. And in 1951, the people’s diplomats of
                        North Vietnam make important visits to China and North Korea under
                        instructions to win international support and sympathy. This is, again, a
                        Vietnamese formulation. The winning of international support and sympathy is
                        a Vietnamese phrase, which appears again repeatedly through Vietnamese
                        texts.</p>
                    <p>So this whole idea of people’s diplomacy is very formalized by Ho Chi Minh in
                        these words in – at a diplomatic conference for North Vietnamese diplomats
                        in January 1964, at which event Ho Chi Minh argues that foreign affairs –
                        I’m quoting – “was not only an area of concern for embassies and consulates
                        general, but also for such organized activities as foreign trade, culture,
                        youth, women, trade unions, agencies, all of which are equally responsible
                        for diplomacy.” And under this definition, Ho Chi Minh excludes Foreign
                        Ministry officials, obviously, from diplomacy. But it doesn’t exclude
                        officials from other government departments, the Communist Party, or even
                        himself from interacting with international peace activists who visit
                        Vietnam, and in an effort to win their support and sympathy.</p>
                    <p>And Ho Chi Minh stresses that the diplomacy practiced by the mass
                        organizations and individuals was equally important as the diplomacy of the
                        state.</p>
                    <p>So one can imagine that the diplomatic front, as Ho Chi Minh conceives it,
                        begins to encompass writers, cartoonists, women, workers, students, artistic
                        performers, filmmakers, architects, medical doctors and nurses, academics,
                        lawyers, and sports persons. And the extended diplomatic front as such
                        encompasses, obviously, antiwar activists, because they, too, oppose the
                        American intervention.</p>
                    <p>So how does it actually work? Now, the North Vietnamese, on the one hand,
                        they initiate people’s diplomacy by going overseas. And they facilitated by
                        welcoming those foreign activists and others and investigative agencies to
                        come and visit them. And in both these styles of their diplomatic
                        engagement, they are actually aiming to provide the antiwar movements
                        overseas with evidence of the effects of American bombardment of North
                        Vietnamese civilians under the Rolling Thunder bombing campaign.</p>
                    <p>So as facilitators and receivers of antiwar support that develops organically
                        outside by the efforts of outsiders, they invite foreign activists to visit
                        and see the human face of the Vietnamese people who are being demonized
                        repeatedly by American officials as vicious communist zealots. So Hanoi
                        relies on people’s diplomacy in noncommunist countries because it was more
                        effective than traditional state diplomacy in gaining the moral support and
                        sympathy of people who were otherwise averse to communism.</p>
                    <p>So, to give you a couple of examples, now, there was one important thing.
                        Now, after visiting North Vietnam, some antiwar activists met with State
                        Department officials in an attempt to persuade them to halt the bombardment
                        of their country. For instance, the Ohio-born Rabbi Abraham Feinberg, who
                        visited Vietnam, North Vietnam, and met Ho Chi Minh in January 1967,
                        insisted that the American bombardment of Vietnam was a violation of
                        international law under the Geneva Agreements and the UN Charter, and it was
                        fruitless because the Vietnamese people, I quote, “could not be terrorized
                        into submission by any foreign power.”</p>
                    <p>And in an attempt at informal diplomacy, the rabbi, who preached at the Holy
                        Blossom Jewish temple in Toronto, briefed the State Department official
                        William Smyser in Washington about an invitation that Feinberg was carrying
                        from Ho Chi Minh for President Lyndon Johnson to visit Hanoi for peace
                        talks. And Feinberg actually then phones the U.S. Ambassador to the United
                        Nations Arthur Goldberg in January 1967. And Goldberg tells Feinberg that he
                        disapproves of the fact that Feinberg had actually released to the media Ho
                        Chi Minh’s invitation before actually delivering it to the State Department.
                        At any rate, Feinberg pleads and he gets Goldberg to deliver the message
                        personally to LBJ because Goldberg was having lunch with LBJ the following –
                        the same afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Now, the face that the North Vietnamese put on people’s diplomacy. There were
                        a number of little-known actors. Now, there was a gentleman called Hoang
                        Quoc Viet, who was keenly watched and reported upon by American observers of
                        this time. The CIA, FBIS reports frequently threw up his name, and – as a
                        talented agitator. And so when the Yale University historian Staughton Lynd
                        and the American peace activist Tom Hayden visit, they meet him because he
                        welcomes them at the airport. And both of them thought that Viet was a trade
                        unionist, and because he was a trade unionist he tended to exaggerate the
                        overall opposition of American workers to the American intervention and
                        participation in the war. So – but they also met another gentleman at the
                        airport called Do Xuan Oanh, the Permanent Secretary of the North Vietnamese
                        Peace Committee, who serves as their guide and friend at most of these
                        visits.</p>
                    <p>Through these conversations, you know, people like Lynd and Hayden are
                        convinced that the Vietnamese revolutionaries are seeking to create a humane
                        socialism and not a ruthless communist dictatorship. And Oanh also seeks to
                        explain that he wanted to educate the people of North Vietnam about American
                        dissidents in order to reduce hatred among the Vietnamese people for the
                        Americans. So when they return home, Lynd and Hayden try in vain to convince
                        State Department officials that the Vietnamese were ready to negotiate.
                        Instead of listening to their pleas, American officials threatened to
                        withdraw their passports on the grounds they had violated the Logan Act,
                        which prohibits American citizens from conducting diplomacy, diplomacy
                        outside of official channels.</p>
                    <p>And then we see in September ’66 the American activist David Dellinger
                        visiting Hanoi, where Oanh again arranges meetings with Ho Chi Minh and Pham
                        Van Dong. And Ho Chi Minh makes a deep impression on David Dellinger, who
                        found him gentle and sincere. And although Dellinger was a dedicated
                        pacifist, he excused revolutionary violence in this case as necessary for
                        the defense of Vietnam against foreign aggression.</p>
                    <p>And so following these early visits, the North Vietnamese begin to formalize
                        a system of hospitality as part of this whole people’s diplomacy idea, based
                        on the seniority and importance of the visitors. And the Hanoi authorities
                        group foreign visitors into few – into two levels, based on their power and
                        ability to influence the outside world. So Nobel Prize winners, well-known
                        university professors, famous writers and filmmakers, are identified as
                        A-level guests, while rank-and-file activists are B-level guests. And the
                        A-level guests are accommodated at the best hotels, they ate at the best
                        restaurants that war-ravaged North Vietnam could offer, and the B-level
                        guests were put up at various government guest houses and ordinary hotels.
                        And usually, foreign visitors paid their own tickets, air tickets, but the
                        North Vietnamese extend local hospitality, including meals and the cost of
                        an accompanying translator. And for instance, three important antiwar
                        activists who fell into the A-level were linguistics professor Noam Chomsky,
                        economist Douglas Dowd, and the pastor Dick Fernandez.</p>
                    <p>The importance of people’s diplomacy within Europe’s left-leaning governments
                        is not so much that it pressures these governments to abandon support for
                        America’s Vietnam policy, as was the case with Britain, Canada, and
                        Australia. It is not surprising that these left-leaning regimes in France
                        and Italy oppose Washington. It’s not that they oppose Washington – it’s not
                        surprising that these regimes oppose Washington. Rather, these settings
                        provide an atmosphere in which people’s diplomacy could flourish.</p>
                    <p>So to cut to the final couple of pages here, how does President Johnson
                        respond to all of this? Or does he respond at all? Because American
                        officials in the CIA, FBIS reports constantly refer to them as propaganda,
                        communist propaganda. I’m arguing that it was more than propaganda, that it
                        was – it may have been perceived as propaganda because that was the mindset
                        that drove the idea that it’s propaganda, because it was from the left wing.
                        But it wasn’t certainly seen as propaganda across Europe, and certainly not
                        by Bertrand Russell and his cohorts in the whole, vast – the east – the
                        Norwegians and the Swedes, for instance.</p>
                    <p>So President Johnson is increasingly concerned that the propaganda campaign
                        conducted by the antiwar movement and the North Vietnamese is giving the
                        United States a bad name. And he complains in June 1965 to Birch Bayh, the
                        Democratic senator from Indiana, that the antiwar activists and the
                        Vietnamese revolutionaries are winning the propaganda war against us. This
                        is in quotes. The president adds, “And they’re also winning the other war
                        against us because they’re winning the propaganda one.” Johnson continues,
                        “They have Harold Wilson on the ropes and they have the prime minister of
                        Canada ducking and dodging.” And then the NSA [National Security Advisor],
                        McGeorge Bundy, warns the president that Wilson, quote, “won’t do anything
                        on Vietnam. His peace people won’t let him.” Of course, this refers to the
                        Labor Party and its great pressures not to go along with Wilson on any of
                        this.</p>
                    <p>So the Johnson Administration couldn’t find more support for its Vietnam
                        policies because of the growing antiwar movements. And nonetheless, these
                        Americans who visit North Vietnam warn the Vietnamese leaders that don’t
                        expect too much from us, that the antiwar movement in America is still
                        small. It has no part to influence the American Government, which is very
                        large, and as yet no match for the size and authority of the American
                        Government. Nonetheless, the Hanoi leaders continue to predict that the
                        antiwar movement would eventually force American – the American Government
                        to withdraw from Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>So, and then Johnson worries about it some more and he keeps saying, as we go
                        along, we’re only getting bad things from the press, he tells McNamara, and
                        they, the communist bloc, do a far better propaganda job than we do. And we
                        – some of these papers yesterday brought this out very well, of how he
                        believed it – well, again, he was actually over-exaggerating this whole
                        problem, because some of the scholarly works on television coverage have
                        shown that, actually, Johnson was getting rather good television coverage.
                        And somehow – but the impression was, in his mind, he wasn’t. But
                        statistically, he was – it’s been shown that he was getting rather good
                        press.</p>
                    <p>So a matter of growing concern to officials in Washington were the
                        transnational lines between Ho Chi Minh and the British philosopher Bertrand
                        Russell. Together, they got together to create the Bertrand Russell Peace
                        Foundation, which then created the international war crimes tribunal to try
                        Lyndon Johnson and Secretary of State and Defense for war crimes in Vietnam,
                        for having used chemical weapons and genocidal strategies.</p>
                    <p>So – and the people of Vietnam used this. Now, it’s not just Ho Chi Minh and
                        Bertrand Russell involved here. It’s really that the people behind – the
                        people’s organizations are actively playing a very important role in
                        liaising with Russell in London through the <hi rend="italic">Cuu Quoc</hi>
                        weekly magazine, because Ho Chi Minh obviously can’t be there, and Russell
                        is too old to travel. He’s 90 years old by this time.</p>
                    <p>So the North Vietnamese have played a very important and very unacknowledged
                        role in the creation of the war crimes tribunal. This historical literature
                        has ignored the fact that they were actually financial stakeholders in the
                        international war crimes tribunal. The fact that Ho Chi Minh contributed in
                        total 50,000 new francs and doubled the amount on getting these activists
                        over to investigate instances of war crimes in Vietnam, which makes the
                        Vietnamese fairly important owners, literally, of the Bertrand Russell War
                        Crimes Tribunal.</p>
                    <p>And of course, the American authorities did everything they could to kind of
                        denounce and disrupt, through various ways – the CIA got into the act and
                        tried to – Under Secretary of State George Ball played a key role in
                        spreading disinformation and persuading foreign heads of state to get – to
                        quit any association with the war crimes tribunal.</p>
                    <p>So in conclusion, one – a couple of paragraphs. The people’s diplomacy, I’m
                        arguing, deserves recognition as a powerful force that the embattled people
                        of Vietnam employ in conjunction with the peace movement abroad to exert
                        popular pressure on the American Government to end the war, and that this
                        all worked, in a way, and that without people’s diplomacy, American leaders
                        would have been less restrained, and they might have tried to prolong the
                        war.</p>
                    <p>I think I should probably stop there. Thanks. (Applause.)</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. MORRIS:</hi> Thank you. I just want to say that what
                        I’m going to be talking about is, in general, the perspective of President
                        Nixon as compared to President Johnson on the use of force in order to
                        achieve a diplomatic outcome. And then what I want to talk about is how this
                        had an effect during two phases of the war, particularly the Cambodian
                        incursion and, more important, the Easter Offensive.</p>
                    <p>Now, I just want to say that most of the so-called lessons of Vietnam have
                        been derived from the experiences of the Kennedy and Johnson Administration.
                        Most recently, a book by Gordon Goldstein on the Kennedy and Johnson
                        Administrations’ Vietnam War decision-making, focusing on the role of
                        National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy, was reported to have been read by
                        the President of the United States and trumpeted as an indispensable reading
                        by the Office of the Vice President prior to the completion of the review of
                        strategy for the Afghanistan war.</p>
                    <p>Few historians, compared to the number who have studied Kennedy and Johnson
                        Administration, have paid attention to the Nixon Administration experience
                        in Vietnam for serious study of Vietnam policy, despite the fact that it was
                        the longest-serving of the Vietnam War administrations, and more important,
                        that in its strategic outlook and policies, it was a radical departure from
                        the previous administrations.</p>
                    <p>The difference between the Johnson and Nixon administrations in their
                        attitude to military strategy and politics are fundamental to understanding
                        their war policies and their relative success and failure. President Johnson
                        was guided in his military policies by one philosophical assumption and
                        three political preconditions. Johnson’s philosophical assumption was that
                        the enemy shared some of the same fundamental universal values: peace as an
                        end in itself, economic prosperity as one of the highest goals, and most
                        important, the necessity of political compromise as a solution to conflict,
                        as the American people and members of the United States Senate. Johnson was
                        very much thinking in terms of his own cultural-political experience.
                        Therefore, he believed the Vietnamese communist leaders might abandon their
                        lifetime ambition to establish a unified communist Vietnam if offered
                        economic incentives of American-sponsored partnership in their economic
                        development. And read President Johnson’s 1965 speech at Johns Hopkins
                        University and you’ll see what I’m talking about.</p>
                    <p>Johnson’s political preconditions for military strategy were, first, domestic
                        politics and policy goals were primary and should provide firm constraints
                        on conduct of the war. Second, international relations with the two major
                        communist powers were too dangerous to undertake military strategies that
                        risk confrontation with them in the Vietnam theater. Third, the United
                        States could not afford to lose for reasons of global credibility, even if
                        it was unable to win.</p>
                    <p>From this evolved a strategy that, one, imposed vigorous restraints on the
                        geographical application of U.S. force, limiting the application of force in
                        North Vietnam and countries neighboring South Vietnam, where the Vietnamese
                        communist enemy forces operated. Two, a military strategy of incrementalism
                        that escalated the scale of military forces and their targets gradually
                        while punctuating them with periodic battlefield pauses, universal –
                        unilateral ceasefires and bombing pauses, as signs of goodwill, in the hope
                        of eliciting a compromise response. And three, the third component of
                        strategy, was a military strategy of attrition that aimed to inflict
                        material and manpower losses on the enemy to a point, a quote “breaking
                        point,” where it could not continue the fight and would decide to compromise
                        on its objectives through peace negotiations.</p>
                    <p>General Westmoreland saw the main threat to South Vietnam as the conventional
                        main forces of the Viet Cong and especially North Vietnam. Thus at his
                        recommendation, the Johnson Administration eschewed counterinsurgency in
                        South Vietnam in favor of conventional military strategies, from which
                        evolve large-unit warfare, search-and-destroy missions in pursuit of the
                        enemy. The Johnson Administration had no strategy of military victory, only
                        one of modulated military punishment that would possibly lead to a
                        negotiated compromise.</p>
                    <p>As we all know, the Johnson Administration policies were an abject failure,
                        except in so far as the United States did not lose the war while Johnson was
                        president. But rather than Johnson finding the communists’ psychological
                        breaking point, the communists found Johnson’s breaking point with the Tet
                        Offensive.</p>
                    <p>President Nixon was drastically different in his philosophical assumptions
                        and in his political preconditions. He believed that the main enemy center
                        of gravity was the military capabilities of the North Vietnamese communist
                        leaders rather than the pain that could be inflicted on its fighting men.
                        Nixon believed that Hanoi’s leaders did not share any fundamental universal
                        values with the United States and were not interested in compromising their
                        fundamental goal of political victory in South Vietnam. He saw negotiations
                        as only being successful if Hanoi was fundamentally defeated militarily.</p>
                    <p>Nixon did not have the same political preconditions as Johnson. Domestic
                        politics were important for Nixon and limiting strategy. Hence,
                        Vietnamization of the war. But he was less constrained by them, by domestic
                        politics, than Johnson, even though many of his senior Cabinet officials,
                        especially Secretary of State William Rogers and Defense Secretary Melvin
                        Laird, were highly sensitive to domestic politics as well as to
                        international opinion.</p>
                    <p>Nixon was less frightened by any adverse reaction of the two major communist
                        powers to his Vietnam strategies than Johnson was, but that confidence was
                        helped and gradually heightened by the evolution of détente with the Soviet
                        Union and the strategic opening and rapprochement with China. Nixon shared
                        Johnson’s precondition that defeat was not an option, but Nixon saw U.S.
                        strategic objectives and a lasting peace as best served by decisive military
                        victories, not incremental force and attrition. Nixon was much more in tune
                        with the strategic outlook of the U.S. professional military, with the
                        strategic outlook of his South Vietnamese allies, and also with the
                        strategic outlook of his Vietnamese communist enemies than Johnson was.</p>
                    <p>From this evolved a dual-aspect military strategy that combined a heightened
                        focus on classic counterinsurgency strategies aimed at destroying the Viet
                        Cong guerrilla capabilities and a conventional strategy that aimed at
                        cutting the enemy’s strategic supply lines and sanctuaries and destroying
                        the enemy infrastructure so as to greatly diminish its capacity to conduct
                        the war. This did not happen immediately but evolved gradually over the
                        first four years of Nixon’s presidency, culminating in the strategic
                        response to the Easter Offensive.</p>
                    <p>Now, it’s widely accepted that the Viet Cong insurgency was fundamentally
                        defeated between 1969 and 1971. That is why Hanoi felt compelled to launch a
                        conventional military offensive in 1972. But it is also true that Nixon
                        inflicted massive damage upon the North Vietnamese conventional war-making
                        capacity in 1972, so much so that I will argue he had found the Hanoi
                        leadership’s breaking point. Now, some of the most compelling evidence of
                        the breaking point argument comes from the archives of the former Communist
                        Party of the Soviet Union. This evidence includes not only the Soviet
                        Union’s own secret evaluations of the military and political situation in
                        North Vietnam but also secret speeches of Vietnamese Communist Party
                        leaders, which have not been published but which were – and I tell this to
                        the Vietnamese friends here – they were covertly acquired by Soviet military
                        intelligence operatives in Vietnam during the war. In other words, your
                        Soviet friends were engaged in espionage activities against you and they got
                        a lot of very interesting information as a result of that. So this is some
                        of the material that I have been looking at.</p>
                    <p>What I want to do is look at the – very briefly at the Cambodian incursion
                        and the Easter Offensive in very broad-brush terms because there’s no time
                        to do it any other way, and to see it as examples of Nixon’s evolution into
                        a successful commander-in-chief in Vietnam who achieved at least a temporary
                        victory in the war.</p>
                    <p>Now, let me first look at the Cambodian incursion. Cambodia was, under Prince
                        Sihanouk, attempting to play a role as a neutral nation in the world. And
                        its foreign policy was not at variance with that of the United States, or
                        was not hostile to that of the United States, until the early 1960s. It’s a
                        complicated story, but basically, in the early 1960s, Prince Sihanouk turned
                        more towards Hanoi and China in his foreign policy. From 1960 – in 1965,
                        Sihanouk broke diplomatic relations with the United States. And from 1965
                        on, the Chinese, Russians, and Czechs were allowed to use the port of
                        Sihanoukville to supply the Vietnamese communist troops in South Vietnam.
                        And the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong were allowed use of eastern provinces
                        of eastern – of Cambodia as a sanctuary in their fight against U.S.
                        imperialism. Sihanouk continued to build these ties with the PRC and the
                        Chinese recognized value in having Sihanouk as an ally. Throughout 1966 and
                        ’67, Sihanouk issued statements supporting Hanoi’s stand on preconditions
                        for negotiations.</p>
                    <p>It was not until the coup d’etat of 1970, however, that the United States
                        began to consider seriously the possibility of direct intervention in
                        Cambodia by U.S. ground combat forces. The Johnson Administration avoided
                        this. Now, Sihanouk’s tilt towards the North Vietnamese was brought to a
                        halt in 1969 and he changed his position and moved towards a more neutral
                        position between North Vietnam and the United States. However, this was
                        rather a reaction in part to domestic issues, including the concerns of his
                        army. In an interview with the American journalist Stanley Karnow, Sihanouk
                        indicated that his government would do nothing if the United States attacked
                        Vietnamese communist bases in remote areas of the country. He would only
                        retaliate if Cambodians were killed. The same message was repeated to U.S.
                        Government envoy Chester Bowles in Phnom Penh in January 1968. However, the
                        messages from Sihanouk fell on deaf ears within the Johnson Administration.
                        President Johnson was faced with many questions about his existing strategy
                        in Vietnam, and the shock of the 1968 Tet Offensive turned him against any
                        consideration of voiding the geographical boundaries of the war.</p>
                    <p>Now, from the early stages of the Nixon Administration, there was
                        consideration of change to the Johnson Administration’s policy. However,
                        there was no evidence that the United States, in considering policies such
                        as bombing of Cambodia, had any interest in overthrowing Sihanouk. On the
                        contrary, President Nixon’s policy was one of trying to engage Sihanouk and
                        try and develop friendly diplomatic relations. One had – at the same time, a
                        decision was made to undertake bombing of Cambodia, which began in August of
                        1969, the so-called secret bombing which was not at all a secret.</p>
                    <p>Sihanouk was, of course, not at all unhappy about that and he was able to
                        make a position – take a position which was intermediate between the two.
                        However, Sihanouk was not completely in charge of his own domestic political
                        situation, and in 1970, he was overthrown by a coup d’etat. Examining the
                        U.S. archives, you will find not only no evidence that the U.S. was involved
                        in the coup d’etat against Sihanouk, but evidence that it could not have
                        been. It was almost – and certainly not been. I don’t have time to go
                        through the evidence now, but if you want to bring it up in discussion, we
                        can.</p>
                    <p>Now, the coup, I think, however, was not to the advantage of the United
                        States, because Sihanouk was a fundamental political asset in Cambodia. And
                        had the original Nixon plan to try and engage Sihanouk and bring him into a
                        closer relationship with the United States been successful, his political
                        attributes – he was a political asset which would turn the balance of forces
                        in favor of the United States in any future confrontation with North
                        Vietnam. By Sihanouk being overthrown, he threw in his lot with the North
                        Vietnamese, with China, and eventually with the Khmer Rouge. And that,
                        therefore, made – by doing so, he became an asset against the United States.
                        So the coup d’etat was a disaster. But it’s very important to understand
                        that the United States neither instigated nor was involved in the coup, and
                        it was a tragedy from the point of view of the United States policy because
                        the Cambodian Government without Sihanouk was an extremely weak
                        government.</p>
                    <p>Now, the incursion was – that took place six weeks after the coup d’etat came
                        after North Vietnamese forces decided that they would attack the Government
                        of Cambodia. The Government of Cambodia, the new government, had wanted to
                        remove North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces from Cambodia. It didn’t have
                        the means to do so. And it was an example of many, many different aspects of
                        the irrationality of the Cambodian Government. However, they incited the
                        North Vietnamese, therefore, by – without having any backup from the United
                        States, to launch an attack upon them. And in the context of that, in the
                        context of the possible loss of Cambodia, it was decided by the United
                        States that it had to intervene in Cambodia, it had to go after the North
                        Vietnamese, because the whole Vietnamization program was in danger if North
                        Vietnam was able to really establish full control over Cambodia and bring
                        back Sihanouk and their own influence.</p>
                    <p>The view was if Cambodia became a de facto communist state, even under the –
                        even with the appearance of the royal government, it would be a far more
                        dangerous place for the United States policy in Vietnam than otherwise. It
                        was a Catch-22 situation for the United States. It was an extremely
                        difficult one. It’s a very hard judgment call for anyone to make now on what
                        should have been done, but at least it made sense to the United States at
                        that time.</p>
                    <p>Now, the consequences of the incursion were that the – was – I would argue
                        that the incursion had a mixed result. On the positive side for the United
                        States, it led to a protection of the pacification program in the two major
                        areas of South Vietnam, Three Corps and Four Corps. I personally experienced
                        the drastic changes in the security in the southern half of South Vietnam in
                        visits there as an Australian student in 1970 and 1972. In 1970, it was
                        impossible for me to travel unescorted in most of the rural countryside, day
                        or night. In January in 1972, it had become possible for a Western visitor
                        to travel in safety without military escort throughout the southern
                        countryside by day or night, a condition that had not been possible two
                        years earlier. So this Cambodia sanctuary clearing was one factor, not the
                        only factor, but one factor making this enhanced security possible.</p>
                    <p>The North Vietnamese, however, moved deeper into Cambodia and were able to
                        create a zone – liberated zones in Cambodia which were very important for
                        the eventual victory of the Khmer Rouge. So that was the downside. There was
                        a plus side and a downside.</p>
                    <p>However, I want to say that, from the point of view of the North Vietnamese,
                        they were also affected psychologically by that, and I think that’s a very
                        important thing to understand. In a speech by Hoang Anh in, to, a plenum of
                        the Central Committee at the end of 1970, he noted Nixon’s bold move into
                        going into Cambodia. And he pointed out that the supply of our forces in
                        1970 was made more difficult than previously, when we were able to use a
                        seaport. But after a coup in Cambodia, we were deprived of this possibility.
                        Besides that, we intended to fulfill part of the supply by air, using
                        airports in Cambodia for this, but until now, we have decided not to do this
                        because of the danger that our aircraft will be attacked and shut down. That
                        is why, at the present time, as in old days, we continue to carry out supply
                        by the land route through Laos, and we’re still having difficulty supplying
                        personnel, arms, and ammunition.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, Hoang Anh pointed out that the North Vietnamese now feared –
                        because of the boldness displayed by President Nixon, he feared that there
                        could be an American landing in North Vietnam. There was American military
                        planning for such a possibility, but it was never politically contemplated.
                        However, the North Vietnamese, and Hoang Anh in his report, indicated that
                        if the United States did land in North Vietnam at a key military junction
                        point, it would create enormous difficulties for them, very serious
                        difficulties for them, and the whole war effort would be challenged. So, in
                        summary about – with regard to the Cambodia incursion, I believe that it was
                        not a clear positive or negative for the United States. It was a mixed
                        bag.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the Easter Offensive, I’m far more – I have come to the
                        conclusion far more that it was a great success, for the United States and
                        for Nixon’s strategy. I can’t go into the details of what actually happened.
                        Those of you who are familiar with the subject that will know that both Dale
                        Andrade, who’s in the audience, and Steve Randolph, who’s a colleague on the
                        panel, have written outstanding books on this subject, and I recommend those
                        who want to pursue the subject of the Easter Offensive read those two
                        books.</p>
                    <p>Just in a nutshell, the North Vietnamese launched the biggest offensive of
                        the war in 1972 on three fronts, coming down from the North through the
                        Demilitarized Zone, from the northwest of Saigon into Binh Long Province and
                        toward the provincial capital of Xuan Loc, and thirdly, into the central
                        highlands. These – this – the battles of the 1972 Easter Offensive were the
                        bloodiest of the war, and they ultimately resulted in massive losses, not
                        only for the South Vietnamese, but more important, for the North Vietnamese
                        – bloody losses which they did not anticipate. Secondly, the United States
                        began a bombing campaign of North Vietnam and a mining of HaiphongHarbor.
                        The mining of HaiphongHarbor had some success, but it wasn’t as effective as
                        had been hoped. The bombing of North Vietnam, however, was devastating. The
                        B-52 was the most potent piece of artillery that the United States
                        possessed, and it had not only an effect on the physical capabilities of the
                        North Vietnamese but also psychologically upon the soldiers.</p>
                    <p>The Nixon Administration had one advantage that the Chinese, the Johnson
                        Administration did not have, in that, by 1968, it had acquired smart weapons
                        – smart weapons, laser-guided munitions, which were not only more accurate
                        but also caused less collateral damage, less civilian casualties, so that,
                        therefore, the advantage in technology the United States had enabled Nixon
                        to be more successful in his bombing than had previously been possible under
                        Johnson.</p>
                    <p>Now, how do we know that this bombing had a success on the North Vietnamese
                        position? Largely by result of their diplomatic position. First of all, I’ve
                        read two speeches by General Tran Van Quang, one on June 26th to the
                        Politburo in Hanoi. First, on June 26, 1972, General Quang indicated that
                        the North Vietnamese were surprised at the U.S. reaction to the Easter
                        Offensive. He said we knew the Americans would resume the bombings, but felt
                        that they would not lay strikes north of the 20th parallel. In fact, it
                        turned out the Americans attacked Hanoi. At first this was unexpected by us.
                        Secondly, he went on to talk about the success of the bombing on their
                        military targets. However, Quang said that all was not lost and the enemy
                        had – and that the enemy had suffered at the hands of the North Vietnamese
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>Now, he went on to say that what the relationship was between fighting and
                        diplomacy. At the present time, he said – General – I’m quoting from General
                        Quang: “At present time, the central issue is the Paris peace accords on
                        Vietnam. Nixon and Laird are seeking a means for the creation of favorable
                        conditions on the fronts in order to have a durable position at the peace
                        talks. Nixon wants to resolve the Vietnam issue by means of peace
                        negotiations.” And then he goes on to say, “In reaction, we’re preparing for
                        the liberation of Hue. The liberation of Hue, following the liberation of
                        Quang Tri, shall have a major political significance. It can facilitate
                        Nixon’s loss during the upcoming elections. Therefore, we must liberate Hue
                        prior to the presidential elections at any price, despite any difficulties.”
                        Now this – and he also pointed out that the beginning of the operations for
                        the liberation of Hue is set for September of 1972.</p>
                    <p>Now, when I look at the second speech by General Quang in September of 1972,
                        on September 15th, a document which became famous when I gave it to the New
                        York Times in April of 1993, you’ll find that General Quang was no longer
                        talking about the liberation of Hue. This had been – was no longer an
                        objective. Instead, the three issues that he raised had nothing to do with
                        future political strategy.</p>
                    <p>To sum up, and I’m coming to the end of this now, Kissinger’s meeting in
                        October 8th with Le Duc Tho is an important meeting, because at that meeting
                        Le Duc Tho made a number of important concessions on negotiations and
                        basically accepted the key and fundamental parts of President Nixon’s May
                        1972 peace proposal. This was the most important breakthrough in the
                        negotiations which had been achieved. And by looking at the Soviet archives,
                        I’ve been able to discover that the North Vietnamese leadership was
                        basically in internal conflict over what happened in the war and what the
                        political consequences would be. And a struggle took place between elements
                        in the Politburo over whether the war could be won by primarily military
                        means. The key person in all of these discussions was Pham Van Dong. And
                        Pham Van Dong was somebody who believed that, ultimately, the war ought to
                        be won by primarily political and diplomatic means, not by military –
                        primarily military means. That was not the position of the majority of the
                        Politburo until the end of September, early October of 1972. At an
                        extraordinary plenum of the Central – of the Politburo in October of 1972, a
                        majority of the Politburo came to Pham Van Dong’s position, and
                        interestingly Le Duan, the General Secretary, was in a minority.</p>
                    <p>So as a result, we see the basic background for the concessions that Le Duc
                        Tho was willing to make to Dr. Kissinger. They came about as a result of a
                        debate within the Vietnamese Communist Party, and that debate within the
                        Vietnamese Communist Party was the result of enormous losses which were
                        suffered in the Easter Offensive, losses that went beyond what they
                        anticipated and were willing to accept for the future.</p>
                    <p>So we’re at – I will end my talk and say to you that I think that President
                        Nixon, on foreign policy, was one of the most successful foreign policy
                        presidents. Although he has been given a lot of credit for his diplomacy
                        with regard to China and the Soviet Union, he was also a very successful
                        commander-in-chief. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">DR. KEEFER:</hi> Our next panelist is Stephen Randolph,
                        associate dean of faculty at the IndustrialCollege of the Armed Forces at
                        the National Defense University. He is a graduate of the Air Force Academy,
                        was an Air Force pilot, got his – after he retired, he got his PhD from
                        George Washington University, and within an in-ordinarily short amount of
                        time, I say with a bit of envy, his dissertation was published into a very
                        important book, <hi rend="italic">Powerful and Brutal Weapons: Nixon,
                            Kissinger, and the Easter Offensive</hi>.</p>
                    <p>So I welcome Doctor Randolph.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. RANDOLPH:</hi> Let me start by joining everybody
                        else who’s appeared up here and express my appreciation to John and to Ed
                        and all of the folks who made this conference possible, and beyond that,
                        this miracle of these volumes and the material that’s come out here. I think
                        it really is a monumental achievement and one that will stand for a long,
                        long time. I’d be a little bit more grateful if they’d gotten my volume out
                        more than a week ago.</p>
                    <p>I’ve been doing some high-speed scholarship getting ready for this appearance
                        here. And it’s been one of the charming and kind of unexpected aspects of
                        this conference that so many people have talked about their personal
                        experience with the Vietnam War, and it reminds us all how this war has
                        touched us all and continues to touch us all. And I thought, well, what the
                        heck? I’ll play.</p>
                    <p>I grew up on a farm in the Central Valley of California. My dad was a farmer.
                        He’d been a bomber pilot in World War II. He taught me how to fly. And when
                        the time came, I was a football recruit at the Air Force Academy, and it
                        seemed just perfectly natural that I would go. And it was natural for him to
                        support the war because that’s what Americans used to do. It was
                        unquestioning. And so I went off to the AirForceAcademy. I got there a month
                        after KentState, to give you an idea of the kind of society we were living
                        in at the time, graduated in 1974. And not until years later did I learn
                        that my mom had lived in dread that this forever war would last until I
                        could join it and deploy downrange and it would engulf her family.</p>
                    <p>When I got to my operational career flying F-4s, it was interesting. I was
                        stationed in Germany and all the people that were my commanders – my flight
                        commander, my instructor – they were all Southeast Asia veterans but we
                        rarely talked about the war, although they did know some cool songs. We were
                        all waiting for the real war, and that was the one on the central front.</p>
                    <p>And so time drifted by and I got back to the war about 10 years ago in a
                        desperate search for a dissertation topic. Dale Andrade had done this
                        wonderful book on the Easter Offensive, but there was more to be done, I
                        thought, on the air side of it. And I started studying the air action of
                        that offensive. And you can drop how many bridges, killed how many trucks,
                        how many tanks, but what does it all mean? None of that matters until you
                        understand what people were trying to achieve with this offensive. And so
                        that got me then into the Nixon papers, the Nixon tapes, to understand the
                        strategic intent of all that. And I’ve been there happily ever since in my
                        own little Idaho.</p>
                    <p>And what I like about the Nixon papers, and it continues to absorb me, is the
                        drama. It is the drama. It is so Shakespearian: three people like Nixon and
                        Kissinger and Haig with this incredible mix of strengths and weaknesses that
                        we’ve witnessed up here, as a matter of fact, and this interplay among them.
                        More Shakespearian than most of Shakespeare, to be honest with you. And then
                        you’ve got the dukes and the earls that come in every once in a while to
                        provide a foil and advance the action. Who are those? It’s Laird, it’s
                        Rogers, it’s Moorer.</p>
                    <p>Rogers, before I forget, I don’t think he ever shows up signing any of the
                        papers in this 1,241 volume [sic pages]dealing with the culmination of this
                        war, not a single one. And then, when the tension gets too high or the
                        action starts to drag, you hauling Spiro Agnew for comic relief. (Laughter.)
                        And it’s always a joy to see him enter. It is always a joy.</p>
                    <p>The other thing about this, and Stephen kind of touched on this a little bit,
                        is that Nixon’s war follows exactly the five-act structure of Shakespearian
                        drama. You’ve got ’69, where everybody’s getting to know each other and kind
                        of get things figured out and you set up relationships. You need a
                        propelling act to spin this thing into the drama, and that is Cambodia in
                        1970. Act Three is Lam Son 719, and that’s when this thing begins to
                        converge toward a conclusion. Act Four, which Stephen talked about, the
                        Easter Offensive and Linebacker, propels this thing toward a conclusion. And
                        Act Five, which is what I’m about to talk about, everything becomes
                        manifest. All the hidden flaws of character and plot and relationships,
                        there’s this terrible cataclysm. And you set the basis either then for a
                        reconciliation of this terrible conflict or a sequel. Stand by me to the end
                        of this talk and we’ll see where it all goes.</p>
                    <p>Okay, a little bit on the chronology. Stephen talked about it. You had the
                        Easter Offensive. We obviously have a lot to talk about, since we’re
                        basically working on the same book. But the Easter Offensive, these
                        conferences that he talked about, what you have are Politburo deliberations
                        dealing down from their original objectives for the offensive. What they
                        wanted to do was create a negotiated settlement that would get the Americans
                        out, leave the North Vietnamese in country, set up a coalition government
                        with an easy transition finally to a communist-controlled state. And when
                        the offensive stagnated because of the steps that Stephen talked about, now
                        the Politburo gets together and they start prioritizing among their
                        objectives because they can’t have it all. They haven’t gotten as much on
                        the ground as they wanted. And what they prioritized, then, was in a very
                        careful set of deliberations – North Vietnamese army has to stay in country,
                        the Americans have to go, there has to be some form of political recognition
                        of the People’s Revolutionary Government and their right to a legitimate
                        existence in South Vietnam, and reparations or reconstitution or whatever
                        word you want to use for it, but basically financial support from the
                        Americans. And they traded away the political terms that they’d been
                        fighting for, for so many years. That was driven by the stagnation of the
                        Easter Offensive.</p>
                    <p>What I want to say, first of all, in kind of a little bit of a reaction to
                        some of the things that have come here before – negotiations, when you make
                        that a personal confrontation between Kissinger and Le Duc Tho, you are
                        trivializing a very, very important and complex set of relationships. The
                        Politburo was setting its conditions in this feverish discussion back in
                        Hanoi, prioritizing things. And Le Duc Tho was staying within that guidance
                        very, very skillfully. And what they told him was go for these objectives
                        and trade off everything outside of that. And when you read the record of
                        these negotiations, keep that in mind, because Kissinger is winning
                        everything outside of those core objectives. And they stand, then, through
                        the end of the January negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The second thing I wanted to mention, and this has to do with what Ambassador
                        Negroponte said this morning, is it was Kissinger who was using the election
                        as a relentless driving timeline to complete this peace settlement. It was
                        him who was driving the North Vietnamese. And he kept saying if you think
                        this guy is tough before the election, wait until you see what he’s like
                        after. And so both sides were racing to the finish line. It’s not like Le
                        Duc Tho said, hey, I got this idea on October 8th and suddenly he tricked
                        Kissinger. That was Kissinger basically falling on his own punji stick right
                        there.</p>
                    <p>So what followed, then, was Kissinger goes racing off to Saigon to try to
                        convince President Thieu that 14 divisions on his territory were really just
                        fine. Thieu, of course, rejected those terms and there was a second round of
                        negotiations in late November where Kissinger attempts to represent the
                        South Vietnamese position, which also fails. But there’s a very creative
                        interlude now where they almost converge on this de facto withdrawal of
                        North Vietnamese troops across the DMZ, a hundred thousand of them, in
                        return for the South Vietnamese releasing prisoners, the civilian and
                        military detainees, out of their prisons. But I think Le Duc Tho got ahead
                        of Politburo guidance on that one. It all went away. They tried it once
                        again in December. They came agonizingly close to a negotiated settlement.
                        Two symbolic, almost nonexistent, areas of difference between the two
                        countries, one on the modalities of crossing the DMZ, which was then and
                        would forever be under the sole control of the North Vietnamese army, and
                        the other on how the signing peace agreement would be conducted. And on this
                        basis, now, we undergo this massive military action.</p>
                    <p>What things do we see in this volume and the other material? The first thing,
                        to quote my esteemed colleague here, John Carland, is the ascendancy of Al
                        Haig. And this matters a lot because there’s a lot of material out there on
                        the Nixon-Kissinger relationship, and if you miss the ascendancy of Haig in
                        this period, you are missing the story. This is especially evident in
                        October and December. Kissinger is downrange negotiating with Le Duc Tho.
                        Haig is next to Nixon in the White House. And so Haig’s, in getting the
                        cables from Kissinger, interpreting them for Nixon, talking to Nixon, and
                        then relaying Nixon’s response back to Kissinger. This, of course, drove
                        Kissinger completely crazy, which is very satisfying to read in these
                        accounts. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>The other thing that is really, I think, extremely important here is that
                        Nixon was genuinely concerned about Kissinger’s negotiating tactics and
                        about his emotional stability. And that comes out very clearly in these
                        documents in some pretty shocking ways, really. The other thing is he’s
                        really sick and tired of these endless squabbles with Rogers and Laird. It
                        is tiresome. It comes at a cost. So Haig becomes the most trusted advisor in
                        this period of time. And why does it matter? It’s because Haig, in all of
                        these conversations with Nixon, is a firm, resolute proponent to be ready to
                        make what they called a massive turn to the right. If the time came, you
                        need to be ready to use massive force to blast this impasse away. And Nixon
                        was by no means eager to do this. He knew the price that he would pay. And
                        yet, it was this kind of relentless, ceaseless advocacy on the part of Haig
                        that then leads finally to the Christmas bombing, to the extent that you can
                        trace in the three offenses, air offensives, that we executed in 1972, the
                        personalities and philosophies of power of their primary architects. Freedom
                        Train in April: incremental, precise, limited, signaling. That’s Kissinger.
                        Linebacker: this relentless, ceaseless application of force. That’s Nixon,
                        closely tied to the diplomatic action. And Haig is just pure brute force.
                        Brutal was his favorite word, and that’s the way he liked to use the
                        military instrument.</p>
                    <p>Related to that in this period of time is the progressive centralization and
                        what you might call a toxification of decision-making in the White House.
                        And this is not going to cause any headlines tomorrow. But it is
                        interesting, if you follow this five-act structure that I’ve outlined, to
                        look at the progressive deterioration of the formal decision-making
                        structure through the Nixon Administration. In ’69, when they’re addressing
                        these options, it looks a lot like a normal government. The State Department
                        people are talking to the NSC, they’re writing papers, Secretary Rogers gets
                        a vote. By ’70, as Stephen mentioned, basically the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        are out of that picture but there were NSC deliberations on that. For Lam
                        Son in ’71, there was this bizarre kabuki theater that would make the people
                        think that they were being consulted but the decision had been made long
                        since for the Easter Offensive on May the 4th. And you can all listen online
                        to these conversations. There was this conference in the White House where
                        Nixon, Kissinger, Haig, Connally at that point, and more, all got together
                        and basically decided on this thing. And then they had a ritualistic NSC
                        meeting so that Nixon could avoid talking to Rogers on the subject. It’s all
                        right there in black-and-white, folks.</p>
                    <p>At this point now in late ’72, Connally’s gone. Moorer has completely lost
                        favor within the White House. And some of the language about him, they say,
                        they call him a Navy lobbyist who doesn’t give a damn for this war. Later
                        on, they call him a whore because he’ll do anything the President wants. So
                        you have your choice of agreeing with the President and being called that or
                        disagreeing with him and being considered disloyal. This is a toxic
                        environment here, folks.</p>
                    <p>And it emerges most clearly – and this is kind of the centerpiece of the talk
                        here – that Linebacker II was only the most vivid but not even probably the
                        most effective of a three-month campaign of coercion and cooptation that was
                        wielded against both Vietnamese parties by the Nixon White House to enable
                        America to extricate itself from this war. When the title of my talk here is
                        Turning on Both Sides, that’s exactly how Kissinger phrased it and that’s
                        exactly what they did. When they turned on the South Vietnamese, it is
                        actually a more existential threat than that levied against the North. You
                        had these constant stream of messages and visitors threatening the cutoff of
                        military and economic aid. On the other hand, flushing a billion dollars
                        worth of equipment into theater in the Enhanced Plus Program, the equipment
                        of which they couldn’t use or maintain or even store, but it was a way to
                        try to buy Thieu’s acceptance of these terms. Against the North Vietnamese,
                        you had this constant convergence of the war aims, the negotiating terms.
                        It’s very important, this agreement, to support reconstruction. And finally,
                        this resort to force. So this is a campaign against both Vietnamese
                        parties.</p>
                    <p>A couple things that didn’t happen that I find interesting. First of all, the
                        Agnew ploy, which is interesting because there was about a two-month
                        constant series of deliberations on the idea of sending Spiro Agnew to
                        Saigon to represent Nixon, not to negotiate, God knows, but as a messenger
                        to Thieu to say time to get on board and knock it off; we’re done. And it’s
                        interesting, because you get to hear Nixon and Kissinger talk about Agnew,
                        but more so because Agnew is not going there because he’s uniquely gifted as
                        a diplomat. He’s going there because he is the standard bearer of the
                        American right and Nixon has always worried about his right flank. He’d
                        given up the left, given up the press, given up the liberals – not too sure,
                        though, about Reagan and Goldwater and Stennis and that crowd. That’s what
                        that was all about.</p>
                    <p>Second thing that didn’t happen was the movement toward a bilateral
                        settlement, which, when you get into the records, was a constant, constant
                        possibility, a strategic option that Nixon and Kissinger were ready to
                        execute, to the point where Ambassador Negroponte actually drafted the
                        speech that would announce that switch to a bilateral settlement and try to
                        justify it to the American people. And he drafted the peace terms, a peace
                        settlement, on that basis.</p>
                    <p>The third thing that was striking about this was, particularly in these
                        cables back and forth between Paris and the White House, this discussion of
                        how you would transition, then, to this use of force. Would President Nixon
                        give a speech, then, trying to explain this to the American people? And
                        Kissinger thought it was fundamentally impossible to do this without a
                        presidential address to let the American people understand it. But you guys
                        that were around at the time will remember this dead, deafening silence from
                        the White House, this absolute blanket, not just of the President not
                        talking but dropping a blanket on both military and diplomatic public
                        affairs officers. Not a word. And it was very surrealistic over that
                        Christmas holiday as the bombs fell.</p>
                    <p>Why was that? Well, mostly it was because – and it’s in one of those kind of
                        charming quotes that you find in this latest volume of <hi rend="italic"
                            >FRUS</hi> -- Nixon couldn’t figure out what to say. How do you explain
                        that we’re bombing Hanoi to make Saigon agree to a peace agreement? It’s
                        that issue that we discussed yesterday with respect to that cable that John
                        Prados has mentioned that Kissinger had sent back, although you’ll all be
                        glad to know that Kissinger got over that pretty quickly. Nixon couldn’t
                        figure out how to explain this to the American people, and so there was no
                        speech.</p>
                    <p>Some themes that emerge that are really important: One I call coalition
                        warfare, moral hazard, and the weapons of the week. One of the – I think
                        probably the most powerful thing that emerges from this latest volume is to
                        look at this vicious, protracted, desperate interplay between the United
                        States and the South Vietnamese in this three-month period between October
                        and January of now ’72 to ’73 and the means by which each side tried to
                        exert its will against the other and keep track of and project the decisions
                        of the other side. I think that’s the most interesting new documents that
                        emerge in this volume. And again, on the part of the South Vietnamese, it
                        was an existential struggle. Thieu thought that he was being given the
                        choice of dying, of his country being eliminated quickly if he rejected the
                        agreement or slowly if he accepted it.</p>
                    <p>The second of these is civil-military relations as a competitive, reactive,
                        iterative process. And all of these things are important. There was a
                        beautiful guidance message from Haig going to the military chain of command
                        defining the Linebacker campaign as being psychological, not military, in
                        its objectives – that you had to attack these targets, that’s viciously and
                        completely, and then move on from there. But what happened from there is you
                        get this guidance injected into a military chain of command that is
                        unresponsive, sprawling, and basically does a very, very poor job of
                        campaign analysis. John talked yesterday about that target list we had in
                        September. We had target lists. What we didn’t have is a concept of an
                        integrated campaign that fused the capability of the Navy, tactical air
                        forces, and the B-52s in theater, or did any careful analysis of the North
                        Vietnamese defenses. They, on the other hand – and this is where the work of
                        Merle Pribbenow is so very important in helping us understand this reactive
                        relationship of strategy – the North Vietnamese started planning on
                        defending Hanoi in April of 1972. When we sent the first B-52 raid, it was a
                        night raid on April 16th of ’72. The North Vietnamese didn’t know until the
                        next day that there had been B-52s in that strike force. Our ECM, our
                        capabilities, were so good at blanketing these aircraft. After that, they
                        began a careful technical analysis of the B-52s to the extent of sending
                        their air defense guys down to the panhandle to sit on mountaintops and
                        watch the B-52s execute their mission, so that they could understand the
                        flight patterns and the defensive arrangements around the B-52s. And so they
                        did this very careful analysis, then, with a lot of this internal dialogue
                        on which direction they’re going to come from, where we’re going to put our
                        defenses, how do we combat the jamming patterns.</p>
                    <p>Beyond that, then, though, again in this world of comprehensive planning,
                        their civil defense arrangements – I had the pleasure of hosting Ambassador
                        Tran [Tran Van Tung] in NDU the other day, and in conversation it turned out
                        that he as a young Foreign Service officer evacuated from Hanoi on December
                        12th of ’72. Now this is two days before Nixon decides to execute the
                        campaign. They projected what we were going to do before the decision was
                        made to execute that attack, went out to the northwest. And they did the
                        similar preparations with respect to their transportation network, their
                        civil defense, their air defenses, dispensing supplies so they wouldn’t be
                        destroyed when we attacked the storage areas. And what you get, then, is
                        this blunting of the psychological effect of this air offensive because they
                        shot down 15 B-52s. That is a really bracing thing to see if you’re a
                        Vietnamese air defender, a B-52 arcing through this night sky aflame. And
                        they saw that 15 times, okay?</p>
                    <p>So what comes out of that, then, is a very, very closely struggled diplomatic
                        action. Basically, at the same time of the Christmas bombing, Nixon sent
                        Haig off to Saigon to tell him don’t let this get your hopes up; this is not
                        changing anything. If we get any movement whatever off of the October
                        agreement, we will accept it. And that’s exactly what happened. There was a
                        very minor incremental shift in the North Vietnamese terms, and the Nixon
                        Administration continued to coerce Thieu up to the point in late January
                        when it was now or absolutely never. And at that point, Thieu capitulated
                        and the Paris Peace Accords – and you can all see the quotations floating in
                        the air over my head – the Paris Peace Accords were then signed.</p>
                    <p>And in conclusion, I will say before I can get the hook here, is, you know,
                        there is an enormous benefit to this action in extricating America from the
                        Vietnam War, but we need to all bear in mind the cost, not just in the lives
                        and the treasure and the trauma and everything, but if you look at this from
                        a broader strategic perspective – and I leave this really to your judgment,
                        because I just made this stuff up – the surest way, I think, to prevent
                        America from reentering that war was to leave it as we did, this absolutely
                        untrammeled exercise of executive power, no consultation with Congress, no
                        notification of the American people. The op-ed pieces, the press, everybody
                        just going – just in despair, in despair. And the thought, then, that
                        Congress would permit America now to reengage in that war once we’ve gotten
                        all the POWs out, I just think is hallucinatory. Really is. So I think
                        Watergate is almost secondary to that, and it’s an additional consideration
                        that we need to think about.</p>
                    <p>The other thing, and I guess this is my closing line, is that this is I will
                        say the dispiriting and divisive end to a dispiriting and divisive war. And
                        on that positive note, I will thank you for your attention and await your
                        questions. (Applause.)</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">DR. KEEFER:</hi> In the interest of time, I’m just going
                        to not introduce Bob McMahon. He’s a friend and colleague, former colleague,
                        a well-known scholar. And Bob would you just give your comments, please?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. McMAHON:</hi> Thank you, Ted. And thanks to John
                        Carland and Ed Brynn and company at the Office of the Historian for inviting
                        me to this stimulating and provocative conference. We’re running short of
                        time, unfortunately. It’s hard to pack three papers and a comment into an
                        hour and 45 minute session and also have time for questions, so I’ll try and
                        be as short as I can, which I guess means talking fast.</p>
                    <p>Let me talk first and say a few words about Professor Mehta’s paper. I’ll say
                        a few remarks about each of them in turn and then offer some general
                        concluding thoughts, and then I do hope we’ll have some time for dialogue
                        because these are very important and provocative papers.</p>
                    <p>Professor Mehta describes people’s diplomacy as a form of soft power employed
                        by the North Vietnamese Government in order to influence opinion within the
                        United States and Western Europe. He suggests that the North Vietnamese
                        found natural allies in antiwar movements that had developed in the West and
                        in Asia. I think there’s some tension here, though, between what he at once
                        – at one point refers to as natural allies and at other points refers to as
                        a kind of opposition which is not created or generated by North Vietnamese
                        efforts but is significantly influenced by North Vietnamese efforts. The
                        obvious counter-factual is even if North Vietnam had engaged in no
                        propaganda efforts, would there not still have been massive antiwar
                        movements in the United States and Europe? And then how do you in fact
                        measure the extent of this influence?</p>
                    <p>I suppose we’re all offering personal anecdotes. One of my first exposures to
                        the Vietnam War as a high school student living in Bayside, Queens in New
                        York was when my local public high school – I went to a Catholic high school
                        – was all of the sudden locked down and there were dozens of police cars,
                        and this resulted from a local high school branch of Students for a
                        Democratic Society, which had shown a North Vietnamese film at Bayside High
                        in an effort to expose people to another perspective. This was 1966. And I
                        went on to learn a lot more about the Vietnam War, but that brought it close
                        to home since it was only about three blocks from my house and right next to
                        the basketball courts where I spent most of my time. The people at Bayside
                        High, which is still one of the highest-achieving public schools in New
                        York, were much more politically conscious than people in most high schools
                        throughout the United States at that point in time.</p>
                    <p>So I think there is certainly the phenomenon of the Tom Haydens and the
                        Staughton Lynds and the others who traveled to North Vietnam. We have
                        several books about that, probably more books and articles than we need
                        about a small group of people who traveled to North Vietnam. But the extent
                        to which these folks were really influenced by the people’s diplomacy
                        engaged in by North Vietnam is, I think, an open question. It would be
                        interesting to know what Vietnamese archives reveal about the
                        self-examination that the North Vietnamese Politburo engaged in as it tried
                        to assess the weight of importance of these efforts that it engaged in.
                        Clearly, Professor Mehta demonstrates that there’s a clear connection
                        between standard state-to-state diplomacy and this so-called people’s
                        diplomacy. Clearly, the North Vietnamese saw them as complimentary, much as
                        they saw force and diplomacy, the theme of our session, as complimentary,
                        but did they see them as advancing significantly their own interests? And
                        how does this fit in with the story that Professor Robert Brigham told some
                        time ago about the role of the National Liberation Front and then the
                        People’s Revolutionary Government, which engaged in its own acts of
                        diplomacy, and the importance of the National Liberation Front being
                        recognized as a diplomatic actor by other countries and movements around the
                        world? That’s another dimension of North Vietnamese diplomacy which needs to
                        be weighed in the balance here as well.</p>
                    <p>He suggests that worldwide linkages were formed, sustained by informal
                        diplomacy, which made it difficult for the United States to prolong the war.
                        I guess my response to that is: Really? How do we demonstrate that linkages
                        formed by North Vietnamese propaganda with sufficient importance that they
                        actually led U.S. officials not to do things that they otherwise would have
                        done? Methodologically, I think that’s a very difficult proposition to
                        prove, based on the – at least based on the evidence which is presented in
                        this paper. It’s a rich paper, it’s an interesting paper, it’s an important
                        topic, but I find myself skeptical about the extent to which this is
                        influential. Interesting and influential are not necessarily the same
                        things.</p>
                    <p>Stephen Morris’ paper is one that takes a bold stance which in many respects
                        is contravened by the paper that Professor Randolph offered. It would be
                        interesting, if we have time, to get the two of them in dialogue. He
                        suggests it was – it had – it is widely accepted by scholars that the Viet
                        Cong insurgency was largely defeated between 1969 and 1971. I’m not going to
                        render my own judgment on that, but I would question whether it is widely
                        accepted by scholars. Certainly, David Elliott, a leading scholar,
                        challenged it yesterday. And what precisely does it mean to say that the
                        Viet Cong insurgency was defeated when there are a couple hundred thousand
                        North Vietnamese troops present within the territory of South Vietnam
                        throughout this period? Isn’t that in fact a more critical element of the
                        relationship between force and diplomacy than the relative power or
                        popularity of the insurgency?</p>
                    <p>People raise some analogies to the Korean War. I think it’s important as we –
                        if we want to compare the Korean War to the Vietnam War, to recognize that
                        North Korea never had a quarter of a million troops within South Korean
                        territory at the time that a ceasefire was being negotiated. There was a
                        line that divided North Korean and South Korean troops. And the fundamental
                        negotiating problem that Henry Kissinger faced from ’69 right through the
                        breakthrough in ’72 was whether the United States would or would not accept
                        the continued presence of North Vietnamese troops in the South, troops that
                        the North Vietnamese continued to insist were not there.</p>
                    <p>So, talk about a negotiating deadlock, ultimately – and I think the third
                        paper makes this point very clear – Nixon and Kissinger conceded the point
                        three and a half years after entering office and after years of insisting
                        that any troop withdrawals would have to be mutual. Well, you can only
                        insist on the mutuality of troop withdrawals for so long when you are
                        unilaterally withdrawing yours and your enemy is keeping his there. After a
                        while, you do lose some credibility. And we all know how important
                        credibility was to Nixon and Kissinger. Certainly, if I’m a diplomat and I’m
                        negotiating with an opposite number and I’ve got troops and he’s insisting
                        that we must both withdraw our troops simultaneously and he’s withdrawing
                        his and making big public announcements about it, and I know that’s
                        enormously popular with his public, and I’m keeping mine present, ultimately
                        what happens in Cambodia, what happens during the Easter Offensive, in my
                        judgment, is less significant than that fundamental fact that you’re talking
                        about, somewhere on the order of, what, 14 divisions of North Vietnamese
                        troops who don’t budge between 1969 and 1972.</p>
                    <p>Now Professor Morris says despite that fact, and he doesn’t really discuss
                        that fact much, Nixon was one of the most successful U.S.
                        commanders-in-chief in U.S. history. Again, my response is an exclamation
                        point. Really? On what basis? What is the basis for success? How do we
                        render such a wild, wildly positive and optimistic judgment about the
                        success of Nixon’s military efforts? Military efforts have to be geared
                        toward political objectives. What were the political objectives? The
                        political objectives, it seems to me, were a settlement favorable to the
                        interests of the United States. But as Professor Randolph’s paper makes, I
                        think, crystal clear, the endgame of this military-diplomatic strategy is
                        probably best described as a fiasco of Shakespearian proportions. The North
                        Vietnamese, as he makes clear, never compromised on core objectives in the
                        negotiating positions taken by Le Duc Tho in Paris.</p>
                    <p>Yes, it is true, and I think conventional wisdom, that they were
                        significantly punished militarily as a result of the Easter Offensive, but
                        what fundamental concessions did they make to the United States? Again, the
                        14 divisions remained. If American diplomatic – if American military efforts
                        were so punishing, so devastating, so successful, why weren’t the North
                        Vietnamese forced against their will to begin the withdrawal of their troops
                        from the South? They weren’t. And so my verdict would be that this is a
                        sideshow in many respects to the core issue of the war, which is about who
                        will control South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese liked their chances of
                        ultimately controlling South Vietnam once the American troops were
                        withdrawn. In many respects, how we look at the success or the failure of an
                        incursion such as Cambodia and Laos in ’70 and ’71 and the Easter Offensive
                        in ’72 is secondary to the fundamental issue that North Vietnam’s hand was
                        going to be far stronger than the hand of South Vietnam once a negotiated
                        settlement was put in place that allowed them to keep their troops in the
                        South and that ensured – and I think this a critical issue – that there
                        would be no political or congressional support likely for any reintroduction
                        of American forces or any reintroduction of military force in the wake of
                        the 1972 fiasco.</p>
                    <p>Professor Morris refers to the Cambodian incursion as being largely
                        successful, although somewhat ambiguous. And at one point, he says antiwar
                        protests broke out in the United States. That, it seems to me, is like
                        saying the folks in Columbus were disappointed when Michigan defeated Ohio
                        State 70 to nothing. I mean, we’re talking about some of the most epic
                        public protests in the modern history of the United States. More college
                        campuses shut down early as a result of antiwar protests than ever before.
                        The domestic political issue in which Nixon lost, and lost big time, has to
                        be factored into the equation. And as this session, I think, is pushing us
                        to do, we must look for the integration of force, diplomacy, and politics.
                        And we can’t look at any one of those factors in isolation. One of the
                        strengths, I think, great strengths of John Prados’s recent sweeping book
                        about the Vietnam War is I think he does as solid a job as any author I’ve
                        seen in integrating politics with force and with diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>So to sum up, I think there are fascinating issues raised by this – these
                        series of papers. Professor Randolph’s observation that, when we’re looking
                        at the Nixon government and its operation in 1972, we’re not looking at a
                        normal government. We’re not looking at normal high-level officials or
                        normal behavior. We can’t forget that. That’s a critical factor. And his use
                        of the Shakespearian analogy might be useful in that regard. You know,
                        missing the role of Al Haig, as some scholars do, I think is something which
                        goes against the goal of achieving a fuller understanding of what’s going
                        on. His theme and title, Turning on Both Sides, is not only apt but in many
                        respects tragic. That after nearly 60,000 Americans lost their lives to
                        preserve a non-communist Vietnam, the endgame of this conflict is one in
                        which the Americans turn on their allies as well as on their adversaries,
                        and then ultimately accept a settlement that allows the enemy to maintain a
                        quarter of a million troops within the territory of South Vietnam. Again,
                        not a small issue when we assess the overall settlement. Nixon forced, too,
                        to accept a peace agreement Stephen [Morris] said that would doom his
                        country. I think there’s something to be said to that – about that, that
                        these are allies that didn’t trust each other.</p>
                    <p>There’s a document buried away in the 1968 volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Foreign Relations of the U.S.</hi> series, which includes a verbatim
                        conversation between Thieu and Ky, two people, South Vietnam’s president and
                        vice president. Why do we have a record in a U.S. Government publication
                        about a private conversation between the president and the vice president of
                        our close allies? Undoubtedly, there was a wiretapping or there was a source
                        at the highest level of the South Vietnamese Government. One doesn’t have to
                        be particularly ingenious to figure this out. How long did this go on? What
                        does that tell us about the nature of the relationship between the United
                        States and its South Vietnamese allies? And one wonders, is that the tip of
                        the iceberg? I know something from being a member of the State Department’s
                        Historical Advisory Committee on the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> series that
                        sometimes battles are long and drawn out and bloody about the
                        declassification of intelligence materials. So one wonders if this document
                        which found its way into our <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> series is
                        indicative of the fact that the United States might in fact have had a lot
                        more information about internal deliberations within Saigon than previous
                        historians have suspected.</p>
                    <p>So these issues, these big issues about the relationship between force and
                        diplomacy, and I would add politics, I think are crucial to the
                        understanding of the entire Vietnam War period, but especially to the
                        complexities of the period from 1969 to 1972, which the recent volumes in
                        the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the U.S.</hi> series have done
                        such a superb job documenting. Thanks. (Applause.)</p>

                        have any time for questions?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. CARLAND:</hi> A couple of questions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. KEEFER:</hi> Yeah. Let me allow any of the panelists
                        one minute to respond to anything, to Bob’s very interesting comments.
                        (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>Yeah.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PARTICIPANT:</hi> One minute.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. MORRIS:</hi> One minute. What did the defeat – I said
                        the Viet Cong insurgency was defeated, it’s widely accepted, by the end of
                        1971. Pointing that the North Vietnamese troops were allowed to remain in
                        the South does not disprove that the insurgency was defeated. They were two
                        completely separate aspects of the war. And my point still stands that, not
                        only from my own experience, the experience of so many others who traveled
                        in the South Vietnamese countryside in 1972, The Viet Cong were no longer a
                        potent force in the majority of South Vietnamese villages, and especially in
                        the Mekong Delta.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, what does success as commander-in-chief mean? And Bob says that we
                        didn’t get the North Vietnamese troops out. Success as commander-in-chief
                        meant that he moved the other side diplomatically through the use of
                        military force. That was my argument. It wasn’t that he got the best
                        possible peace agreement. It wasn’t even that he got a good peace agreement,
                        but he moved the other side substantially diplomatically as a result of
                        force in such a way that he thought it would work. And I would like,
                        therefore, to point out also that the argument that Kissinger made, or Nixon
                        thought, both of them, with regard to the future of South Vietnam without
                        American forces was that they still had the opportunity to bring back U.S.
                        air power. Now, it didn’t happen because of Watergate. Watergate emasculated
                        the president and it was no longer possible for him to use U.S. air power.
                        But U.S. air power was the counterweight to the existence of 14 North
                        Vietnamese divisions. And I would point out they did not control most of the
                        populated areas. And Soviet documents make extremely clear that in the late
                        1973 – by September of 1973, the Battle of the Flags in South Vietnam had
                        gone so far on the side of the South Vietnamese Government of President
                        Thieu that they wondered – they wondered whether there would be territory
                        with people in it whereby they – where they could raise the flag of the
                        Provisional Revolutionary Government.</p>
                    <p>So therefore – all right, my minute’s up. And just one more point.
                        (Laughter.) One sentence. If you wonder whether the use of air power as a
                        counterweight to the presence of 14 divisions was relevant, read General
                        Tran Van Tra’s account of the final offensive, where he makes it clear that
                        the Politburo was tentative about launching that offensive in ’74-’75. They
                        were planning for ’76, not ’74-’75. But they saw the collapse of the home
                        front in America and they wondered. The only question they had was, will
                        Nixon – will Ford bring back U.S. air power? That was their question. They
                        did a feint, they tested it, they saw there was no U.S. air power, and they
                        went ahead. So that was the point and the argument and the logic and the
                        rationality of Commander-in-Chief Nixon, and he was not able to predict his
                        own demise, which sabotaged the whole plan.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. KEEFER:</hi> Steve, would you like to – or you wish –
                        any other responses? Or can we open it up to –</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF MEHTA:</hi> I just have – yeah.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. KEEFER:</hi> You have one minute.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. MEHTA:</hi> Okay. I’d like to thank Professor
                        McMahon for his very detailed remarks. And I think the fact that there’s a
                        tension between national and outside efforts, there certainly is. And I
                        don’t – in fact, that’s the point I make in the paper, that people’s
                        diplomacy was both directed outwards and inwards.</p>
                    <p>To the point that whether – can you imagine an antiwar movement in the West,
                        not just in the United States, because people’s diplomacy went not just to
                        America but also to Europe in a much bigger way, Japan, Asia, as well as the
                        communist world. So can you imagine an antiwar movement without any visits
                        by American activists? Hayden, Dellinger. Hayden and Dellinger, before they
                        actually went, had no clue as to what – who the North Vietnamese were
                        because there was enough propaganda against them, and they all seemed to be
                        uniformly communist. And it was only after they’d gone that when these
                        people returned, that were they able to actually have town hall meetings in
                        America. And when the press dismissed them as communist dupes, that they
                        actually went out and – they actually went out and started having town hall
                        meetings.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. KEEFER:</hi> Well, I’m going to have to stop there.
                        And can I have, like, one question? Or two questions?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. CARLAND:</hi> One question and then we break.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. KEEFER:</hi> One question – the best question you can
                        possibly think of. (Laughter.) Yes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION :</hi> You might want to consult – (Inaudible)
                        Rosenblatt to (inaudible) Vietnamese, Cambodian, Lao and Hmong, and I would
                        just note that the demise of the Sihanouk government late in the stages of
                        the war when we knew that the U.S. was not going to participate was one of
                        the fundamental tragedies. It brought Cambodia and its people into the war,
                        where they might have stayed out of it. And of course, we needed some
                        Vietnamese up here to talk about the effects on the ground to the Vietnam
                        front, and not to mention Laos and Cambodia. So I suggest next time we do
                        one of these, we have a panel involving the folks who were most affected.
                        Well, even one hour.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. CARLAND:</hi> That was great. Were--The schedule’s

                        <hi rend="strong">DR. CARLAND:</hi> Appropriately enough, we are now at the
                        point where we have a session titled “Battle for Hearts and Minds:
                        Counterinsurgency and Reconstruction Programs in Vietnam.” The chair, is
                        chaired by Richard Hunt. Dick Hunt, who served in the Army in Vietnam, 1971,
                        as a MACV historian, and then from ’71 to the year 2000, he was historian at
                        the U.S. Army Center of Military History, working on the history of Vietnam
                        and also on the oral history program. Dick and I were colleagues there when
                        I was at the Center also.</p>
                    <p>Since 2002, he has been historian in the Department of Defense Historical
                        Office, researching and writing a volume on Melvin Laird as Secretary of
                        Defense. In addition to writing articles, book reviews, presenting papers,
                        Dick is the author of one of the most important books on the history of the
                        Vietnam War, titled <hi rend="italic">Pacification: The American Struggle
                            for Vietnam’s Hearts and Minds,</hi> a necessary book on America’s
                        pacification efforts there. And thus, he is singularly suited to chair the
                        panel.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">DR. HUNT:</hi> Thank you, John, for those kind words, and
                        thank you for organizing this conference. It’s just been fantastic.</p>
                    <p>Today’s session– this afternoon’s session on counterinsurgency and
                        reconstruction will cover a range of topics and periods, but common to each
                        presentation is an examination of the relationship of the United States with
                        its allies: the French during the first Indochina war and the South
                        Vietnamese during the second Indochina War. The topics range from the work
                        of French and American intelligence organizations in setting up
                        counter-guerrilla programs during the French-Indochina War, U.S.-South
                        Vietnamese differences over Ngo Dinh Diem’s efforts to build rural political
                        support, and U.S.-South Vietnamese disagreements over the concept of
                        national reconciliation, the effort to integrate members of the Viet Cong
                        into South Vietnamese society.</p>
                    <p>The first paper is a joint paper. I’ll be announcing both speakers at the
                        same time and they will smoothly transition from one to the other.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">DR. Le PAGE:</hi> Thank you. French-American intelligence
                        relations were for mostly presented through the prism of Graham Green’s
                        novel, <hi rend="italic">The Quiet American</hi> . This embroidered vision
                        was not completely disconnected from reality as concedes its true nature of
                        the French-American relations in this area, that often necessary but
                        unwanted on a reluctant alliance.</p>
                    <p>We are going to divide our presentation into parts, according to the line of
                        our respective research orientations. I will be talking first on the
                        political and psychological level about interagency services relations.
                        Then, Élie will take over to put some emphasis on those services, even
                        mounting the counterinsurgency.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the experience towards the end of the Second World War, it was
                        only during the ’50s that the French intelligence services were in relations
                        with the U.S. in Asia. What was the kind of relationship between the French
                        and U.S. intelligence services during the French-Indochina War?</p>
                    <p>You can take this copy, please. [handout]</p>
                    <p>The French intelligence services were numerous in Indochina. Near the G2 and
                        the military services, like the SRO [Service of Operational Information, <hi
                            rend="italic">Service de Renseignement Opérationnel</hi> ], specialized
                        in the HUMINT, human intelligence, there was a special service. It was
                        SDECE, for External Documentation and Counter-espionage Service [<hi
                            rend="italic">Service de documentation extérieure et de
                            contre-espionnage]</hi> . The SDECE was divided in four main
                        sub-services: intelligence service against China (inaudible) and Burma,
                        HUMINT agents, the COMINT, with the SDR, and the Action Service.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Belleux was at the head of the SDECE in Indochina. He was always in
                        relation with Paris. Between 1951 and ’57, it was Pierre Boursicot who
                        directed this French intelligence service. SDECE was subordinate to the
                        prime minister’s office. After 1950, the CIA was in Indochina. It was
                        important to specify the relations between French and American services, all
                        the more so as the French authorities were very suspicious about American
                        activities in Vietnam. Since 1949, SDECE maintained a relationship with the
                        British intelligence service. An MI-6 official was working with SDECE in
                        Saigon, and a French officer was in Singapore. The idea was to develop
                        similar links with the CIA.</p>
                    <p>In May-June 1951, Pierre Boursicot met General Bedell Smith, Allen Dulles,
                        and Frank Wisner. A protocol allowed the CIA to operate in Indochina through
                        the United States Embassy in Saigon. Mr. Mac-Clintic, then Mr. Duffield,
                        were the CIA correspondents close to the SDECE. By 1952, there were three:
                        Col. Hall, Mr. Caswell and Patton. They exchanged intelligence on a weekly
                        basis on military matters and communism in the region.</p>
                    <p>Regarding Indochina, in the mind of the head of the SDECE, it was only
                        military matters. The internal political affairs were not concerned by these
                        (inaudible). At last, in July 1954, a new proposition was offered by Langley
                        and executed by the French Government in the context of Geneva agreements.
                        Colonel Belleux and Edward Lansdale would deal with the practical conditions
                        of these future collaborations. But the end of the war caused an agreement
                        proofreading, and some officials of the French intelligence services
                        struggled against the French – the American agencies who maintained the Diem
                        solution.</p>
                    <p>Another collaboration existed between the SDECE and the young NSA. An
                        agreement had been adopted by the two governments to exchange the COMINT,
                        communication intelligence, results, and the SDR and the NSA worked together
                        and they formed a pool against China. The 31st of August 1953, Boursicot and
                        Allan Dulles reached a new step in the collaboration. The end of the Korean
                        War increased American needs and Indochina could be seen as a solution.
                        American operators were in position at Seno, Laos because the Okinawa
                        interception stations were too far away to be able to act in the best
                        conditions to intercept the south-Chinese networks.</p>
                    <p>Communist China was the target. The Korean War demonstrated the difficulties
                        in obtaining intelligence about China. Firstly, in June 1950, when the North
                        Korean army invaded the South; secondly, in November, when the Chinese
                        volunteers attacked the UN forces near the frontier, the different American
                        services were in the dark. Indochina was a battleground of the Cold War and
                        a window for determining the Chinese possibilities and intentions. The
                        collaboration between the Western services was essential, and the
                        Franco-American special services collaboration ran smoothly. However, it was
                        not the same with the French authorities in Indochina and the American
                        services.</p>
                    <p>George W. Allen showed the good relationship between the French G2 officers
                        and their foreign counterparts, but it was not the same with a different
                        commander-in-chief and their general staff. The American intelligence
                        services were in place through military attaches and the officers of the
                        CINCPAC. Some officials of the CIA were formally at the Embassy, but also
                        less officially, in different organizations, like the Special Technical and
                        Economic Mission. The STEM was managed in 1951 by Robert Blum who was close
                        to the CIA. Blum was also the president of the Committee for Free Asia and
                        sustained the struggle of the nationalist states against communism. But at
                        the same time, his views were on the verge of Francophobia and Gen. De
                        Lattre obtained his re-posting.</p>
                    <p>French authorities accepted more or less this presence. In the simplest case,
                        that of the military attaches, an agency was created in the main to
                        facilitate the exchange of intelligence and to control it. This foreign
                        affairs section organized meetings every day in which the G2 took bearing on
                        the military situation and answered questions. Nevertheless, all the
                        sensitive aspects were under control. Normally, this section was the only
                        intelligence network between the French forces and the allies. But some of
                        them were not satisfied with the level of information and the search for
                        more roundabout means.</p>
                    <p>The State Department was discontent about the military attaché reports and
                        put pressure on them. The American representatives in the Hanoi consulate in
                        1952 were embittered towards the French, who didn’t feel the same, according
                        to a Sûreté report, the French political policy in Indochina.</p>
                    <p>This fact, among others, was a result of one of General Salan’s information
                        notes. The French commander-in-chief, between January ’52 and May ’53,
                        denounced the relations during the social gatherings between French officers
                        and their foreign representatives. The rumors collected were sent back and
                        could be used against the French interest. That’s why the officers had to
                        make contact with the military security once they met foreigners, even if
                        they were allies.</p>
                    <p>Nineteen fifty two was the worst year in the relations between the two
                        states. The consequence for the Americans was the poverty and the indigence
                        of their reports. This fact was increased by their weak understanding of the
                        French language because they couldn’t find other sources. It was a French
                        opinion!</p>
                    <p>A similar problem for the French authorities was the U.S. contact with
                        Vietnamese personalities. Moreover, the U.S. representatives were under
                        surveillance. The intelligence agencies excluded political affairs. But as
                        the U.S. wanted information, they contacted Chinese and Vietnamese
                        personalities, as Trinh Minh The – a Cao Dai multi-defector in South Vietnam
                        (inaudible). Furthermore, the French political police reported the
                        constitution of a cell composed of a dozen Chinese and Vietnamese close to
                        the North Vietnam consul. Also, it would seem a radio post had been brought
                        to the Chinese people. (Inaudible) some Vietnamese and Chinese people met
                        the U.S. representative directly and get information. But they were more
                        often biased.</p>
                    <p>Salan couldn’t understand all these maneuvers, and it was the same for a lot
                        of officers and civil servants. During this year, in 1952, we came close to
                        a breakdown. With General Navarre, relations were more simple because he
                        understood the force ratio between the two states. But he was reluctant to
                        give the results of these technical services. For example, in the middle of
                        1953, Navarre decided to increase the French interception capabilities as
                        needed. He was dependent on the U.S. military aid, and the Americans, in
                        compensation, wanted the results of the listening in South China. Navarre,
                        firstly, refused because he wished to protect the COMINT organization. But
                        finally, he had to give this information. There were two main reasons to
                        explain this situation. The French authorities wished to keep control of the
                        war. France accepted the material and financial aid but refused all
                        interference in the conduct of the war.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, to understand Salan’s attitude, we have go back in time to 1945 and
                        the OSS action. It was obvious for the French that American services had
                        given weapons to the Vietnamese. And Major Patti was in Hanoi in September
                        1945 for the declaration of independence of Vietnam. On the other hand, the
                        French officer, Lieutenant Klotz, had been shut down by Vietnamese in the
                        presence of an OSS officer who declared himself neutral and didn’t step in.
                        In the perception, not the reality, but in the perception, numerous French,
                        this facts offered proof of the U.S. double play, and the assassination of
                        Lieutenant Klotz increased the resentment.</p>
                    <p>Who was in Indochina in 1945 and 1952? General Salan or General Jacquin, head
                        of the Tonkin G2. The relations between France and the United States in
                        Indochina was complex, because the French forces was – we have two position
                        in France. The SDECE have had a global vision of the Cold War. And for the
                        SDECE, Indochina was a front like Germany or Korea. But for the authorities
                        in Indochina, we have a local vision and only for the Indochina.</p>
                    <p>But finally, despite the problems, by 1952, the intelligence relations were
                        successful. If De Lattre or Salan were very worried of the U.S. intentions
                        in Indochina, they accepted – and initiated the Western intelligence
                        exchanges after the Singapore Conference in 1951. The perfect collaboration
                        between the intelligence agencies was another proof. And in this game,
                        France was the main beneficiary because all this information filled out
                        their intelligence synthesis.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. TENENBAUM:</hi> Thank you, Jean-Marc. And I will now
                        take over and carry on the presentation on a more applied and operational
                        level, that is the French-American cooperation, or lack of one, in
                        counterinsurgency and specifically in counter-guerrilla operations. Indeed,
                        in Indochina, the action branch of the SDECE was probably one of the most
                        vanguard and innovative service in the French military. Its main innovation,
                        which proved to be seminal in the future of counterinsurgency across the
                        world, was in fact quite linked to the American intelligence service in
                        Indochina. And that is my first subplot, which I call the French-American
                        birth of the GCMA – as the GCMA would see it later.</p>
                    <p>The French-American collaborations in terms of counter-guerrilla issues can
                        be traced back from a 1950 Dean Acheson memorandum to the National Security
                        Council entitled “Collaborations with Friendly Government on Operations
                        Against Guerrillas,” where the Secretary of State states that, quote, “While
                        there has been a certain amount of exchanges of views between the military
                        representative, as in the case of the French in Southeast Asia, it does
                        appear that an organized effort had been made to pool information, skills,
                        and techniques among the friendly nations who have a common interest in
                        defeating this kind of activity.” Here is the memo (shows it to the
                        audience).</p>
                    <p>On the ground, those “exchanges,” as Acheson puts it, were performed by
                        intelligence services, intelligence service officers on both sides. In May
                        1950, at the very time the French were setting up the SDECE station in
                        Indochina, it seems that the CIA actually came out with a plan to create a
                            counter-<hi rend="italic">maquis</hi> . Now, this term of <hi
                            rend="italic">maquis</hi> demands to go back a little bit into time to
                        find the very roots in terms of French and American collaboration in
                        counterinsurgency operations. Indeed, French and U.S. intelligence
                        operatives at the time were deeply impacted by their World War Two
                        experience, as many of them had fought in the French Resistance, actually,
                        often being parachuted in to France from England and trying to activate some
                        guerrillas in the country that was called the <hi rend="italic">maquis</hi>
                        . In France, this joint British-American- and French guerrilla operations
                        were known as Jedburghs.</p>
                    <p>In the Pacific war against the Japanese, the Allies tried to do the same in
                        the jungle. Let’s recall, for instance, Orde Wingate’s Chindits in Burma.
                        The French did the same in Indochina, though it was a bit late, as the
                        Japanese were already falling back. And rapidly, they resorted to these
                        guerrilla tactics in a counter-guerrilla fashion to fight the fledgling Viet
                        Minh, which was itself organizing in a <hi rend="italic">maquis</hi> . So
                        the idea was to put on counter-<hi rend="italic">maquis</hi> on the rear of
                        the Viet Minh <hi rend="italic">maquis</hi> , and thus to switch from
                        guerrilla warfare to counter-guerrilla.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, counter-<hi rend="italic">maquis</hi> required material and
                        funding that the French did not have at the beginning of the war in
                        Indochina. And this is why the Americans, who had been familiar with this
                        method in World War Two in those joint operations, came in in May 1950 with
                        a proposal of activating counter-<hi rend="italic">maquis</hi> in Tonkin,
                        the most infested part of Indochina. It was interesting because there was
                        actually a big secret about who among the Americans made this first
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>I was talking with Mr. Phillips yesterday, that there is a legend among the
                        French former SDECE men that it was actually Lansdale who as soon in May
                        1950 made the proposal, but this is probably untrue because Lansdale had
                        never been to Indochina at this time. It seems, actually, that the
                        negotiations surrounding this proposal were probably conducted on the U.S.
                        side by a certain Thibault de Saint Phalle, who in spite of his French name,
                        was a U.S. citizen, and a CIA agent and, incidentally, a former Jedburgh and
                        Chindit in World War Two.</p>
                    <p>So on the French side, we have Léon Pignon, who was the high commissioner at
                        the time and Maurice Belleux, who was, as Jean-Marc told us, the head of the
                        SDECE in Indochina.</p>
                    <p>According to Saint-Phalle’s memoirs, recently published – a very interesting
                        book, by the way – Saint-Phalle obtained from Pignon, and thanks to the help
                        of a very pro-American French intelligence officer called Colonel Jean
                        Carbonel, that the authorization to train and drill the future Vietnamese
                        cadres of this counter-<hi rend="italic">maquis</hi> at Vung Tau (then Cap
                        Saint-Jacques), in a CIA-organized facility under the U.S. flag. But the
                        plan actually fizzled out when General De Lattre took over in December 1950.
                        De Lattre feared that the Americans would meddle too much in French
                        business, and tried to oppose it. He first thought – obtained Saint-Phalle’s
                        expulsion, actually in ’51. And then, at the Singapore Conference in May
                        1951, which was a meeting of the French, British, and American high commands
                        in Southeast Asia, De Lattre managed basically to oust the CIA from the
                        project.</p>
                    <p>I have here some letters and telegrams from De Lattre’s personal archives,
                        where he violently opposes the project, saying a quote that is main – the
                        most important thing was to avoid, I quote, “that the American put their
                        nose in my business,” and that the secret goal of the Americans was the
                        realization of the guerrilla system controlled by them.</p>
                    <p>So to conclude this first part, there is a deep American involvement as soon
                        as 1950-51 in the very liberation of an original counter-guerrilla strategy
                        in Indochina. And interesting aspect of this paternity is that
                        diplomatically, this involvement finds itself in the wake of NSC-64.
                        Operationally, it bears the weight of a common military memory, that of
                        World War Two joined Franco-American behind-the-lines commando operations.
                        Even if this project are now to be fully internalized by the French
                        military, it does appear that the American in some way, at the origin of
                        what would later be called the GCMA, the <hi rend="italic">Groupes Commandos
                            Mixtes Aéroportés</hi> , a very impressive counter-<hi rend="italic"
                            >maquis</hi> system in the Tonkin and Laos highlands, which happened to
                        be partially recuperated by the Americans at the end of the war. And this is
                        the subject of my second-to-last part. I’ll be brief, thank you.</p>
                    <p>And this, the second part, what I call the French counterinsurgency legacy
                        and its American heirs. Indeed, at the time, the French were falling back
                        from Indochina in mid-1954. The American intelligence service came back to
                        office and back to the counterinsurgency issues as they glimpsed that they
                        would have to carry the burden after the French. And this time, we really
                        have Edward Lansdale being appointed as colonel in the – by John Foster
                        Dulles, actually to head the so-called second military mission, who was, as
                        we heard before, some kind of other CIA station in the country.</p>
                    <p>The second military mission fitted in frame of the TRIM, the Training
                        Relations and Instruction Mission. And according to Lansdale, who seemed
                        very enthusiastic about it at the beginning, the TRIM was a French-American
                        institution charged, to quote Lansdale, “to push French and Americans to
                        work together to help Vietnamese to take control of their own affairs.” The
                        reality was somehow gloomier, as French and Americans did wage a silent war
                        at each other over who would have the most influence on the fledgling
                        state.</p>
                    <p>Inside the TRIM, the SMM -- that is, the CIA – belonged to National Security
                        Division, which was in fact the other name for pacification and
                        counterinsurgency operations. The political conditions and power struggles
                        made the collaboration uneasy between the so-called Allies. And
                        nevertheless, the mission allowed Lansdale to discover the French know-how
                        in terms of counterinsurgency and pacification. For instance, he discovered
                        the GAMOs [<hi rend="italic">Groupes Administratif Mobile Operationnel</hi>
                        ] of General de Linarès from which it dragged the new unit, the Civic Action
                        Teams, which was, like the GAMOs, supposed to, and I quote Lansdale again,
                        “to go out in the countryside and work in the villages to foster self-rule,
                        self-development, and self-defense.” On the GAMOs, I recommend you reading
                        of Jean-Marc’s very good paper on this.</p>
                    <p>But the most impressive SMM borrowing from the French methods was this very
                        idea of a counter-<hi rend="italic">maquis</hi> . The recuperation of an
                        operational strategy is less owed to Lansdale than to his rather obscure
                        second-in-command, the Franco-American Lucien “Lou” Conein. And this sort of
                        super-spook – sorry – who had joined the CIA in 1940 and participated in the
                            <hi rend="italic">maquis</hi> in the French Resistance, then had played
                        somehow a murky role in Indochina in ’45. Indeed, according to the SMM
                        report published in the Pentagon Papers, Conein was, I quote, “a
                        paramilitary specialist well known to the French for his help with the
                        French-operated <hi rend="italic">maquis</hi> in Tonkin against the
                        Japanese” on the one – in the one American guerrilla fighter who had not
                        been a member of the Patti Mission in ’45.</p>
                    <p>So he arrived in Saigon in July ’54. He got in touch with the French SDECE
                        officer, Colonel Jean Carbonel, the very same who had worked with
                        Saint-Phalle in 1950 with the first proposal at the time. And the – so
                        Carbonel actually proposed to Conein establishing a <hi rend="italic"
                            >maquis</hi> , those very <hi rend="italic">maquis</hi> of ’51, in the
                        U.S. proposal. They were now envolving. Those <hi rend="italic">maquis</hi>
                        had now flourished and they were now involving thousands of <hi
                            rend="italic">Montagnards</hi> people in the high region and who fought
                        on the rear guard in the Viet Minh. And the French were leaving. They now
                        counted on Washington to carry on the military and financial support of
                        these irregular units.</p>
                    <p>When Conein reported Carbonel’s proposal to Washington, it was refused, and
                        the <hi rend="italic">Montagnards</hi> were abandoned. Well, nevertheless,
                        the idea proved long-lasting in the intelligence service circles.</p>
                    <p>And this would be my final point. The watchful student of Indochina wars
                        would have certainly noticed the resemblances between the GCMA <hi
                            rend="italic">maquis</hi> of 19 – of the mid-50s and the CIA-funded
                        Laotian and then Vietnamese guerrilla operations in the early ’60s. Well,
                        this is not pure chance. And as a form of conclusion, I would quote a former
                        CIA operative in Laos in 1959, Stuart Methven, whom I interviewed last year,
                        and where he states that General Ouane, who was the Laotian army chief of
                        staff at the time, gave him the very idea to establish exactly – in exactly
                        the same fashion that 10 years earlier the CIA made the first proposal to
                        the French <hi rend="italic">maquis</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Montagnards</hi> .</p>
                    <p>So to conclude, we find U.S. service – intelligence services both at the
                        input and at the output of one of the most important counter-guerrilla
                        experiences in Indochina. And I would say that it is interesting to note
                        that beyond real and frontal political opposition, that when French and
                        American intelligence services in counterinsurgency operations on the
                        operational point of view, they both proved to be able to benefit from the
                        resources of the other.</p>
                    <p>Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p>

                        professor at the University of Western Ontario, where he specializes in

                        an expression of his personalist revolution. His paper will cover
                        conflicting Vietnamese and American notions of political development in the
                        period 1957-1963.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. STEWART:</hi> Thank you, Doctor Hunt. And I’d just
                        like to join everybody else and thank Doctor Carland and the Office of the
                        Historian for the opportunity to come here and speak in front of you
                        all.</p>
                    <p>On March 1st, 1957, the Government of the Republic of Vietnam launched a
                        community development program to promote the active participation of the
                        people and the mobilization of latent community resources in a much larger
                        plan for social and economic development. This larger plan sought to
                        capitalize on Vietnam’s agricultural sector in order to develop the
                        productive capacity of the country and eventually achieve an independent
                        economy that would not be reliant on foreign aid.</p>
                    <p>Community development formed the basis of Ngo Dinh Diem’s plans for
                        nation-building at a local level in the Republic of Vietnam. His aims were
                        to create a viable, noncommunist, and independent nation in the southern
                        half of Vietnam and solve the interrelated problems of overcoming Vietnam’s
                        chronic underdevelopment, which was a legacy of its colonial past, and a
                        burgeoning communist-led insurgency. Now, for the main part, policymakers in
                        the United States, the RVN’s principal ally, shared these goals. Both
                        Eisenhower and Kennedy viewed the establishment of a viable, noncommunist
                        state in South Vietnam as an essential bulwark against the spread of
                        international communism in the global Cold War.</p>
                    <p>Despite these shared aims, relations between the two governments over the
                        scope and the pace of nation-building were often quite tense and at times
                        quite volatile. Diem was a fervent nationalist who ran an authoritarian and
                        autocratic regime, and he jealously guarded his country’s sovereignty. He
                        believed the source of South Vietnam’s strength was found in the traditions
                        of Vietnam’s pre-colonial autonomous villages. Community development was
                        intended to harness this strength to realize his national vision.</p>
                    <p>For their part, many of the individual Americans involved in assisting South
                        Vietnam’s development carried their own preconceptions about nation-building
                        and the role of the United States in the process. Their beliefs were
                        emblematic of their notion of the primacy of America’s place in the world.
                        Now, in both of these cases, Diem and the American policymakers in
                        Washington adhered to the belief that the respective historical experiences
                        of their states were exceptional and uniquely qualified them to carry out
                        development in South Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>This paper examines how these exceptionalist Vietnamese and American notions
                        of development influenced nation-building in South Vietnam. It uses Diem’s
                        Community Development Plan and its militarized offshoot, the Strategic
                        Hamlet Program, as its focal point. Now, it’s premised on the notion that
                        the South Vietnamese had a far greater role in the nation-building process
                        than many previous Western accounts, and this significantly shaped the
                        course of relations between the United States and the RVN.</p>
                    <p>The Presidential Palace in Saigon believed community development could help
                        alleviate Vietnam’s economic condition and thwart the growing strength of
                        the insurgency. It aimed to rally the rural population to take an active
                        role in agricultural development in the hope that this would lead to an
                        increase in purchasing power across the board. This would then theoretically
                        be translated into a greater demand for manufactured goods produced by
                        indigenous light industries, allowing the people of the RVN to build the
                        social and economic infrastructure on which they could base their future
                        industrial development. This would undermine the appeal of the communist
                        model in the North by creating a showcase of successful post-colonial
                        development that would be more enticing than the alternative that Ho Chi
                        Minh had to offer. Over time, Diem hoped, this model state would lure his
                        compatriots in the North to defect in numbers that would bring about the
                        communist regime’s, in the North, eventual collapsed.</p>
                    <p>But more than just a means to contend with the threat of the Hanoi
                        government, Diem believed that community development offered his government
                        a chance to obtain greater control of the RVN’s destiny in the international
                        arena. Diem wanted to ensure that the Republic of Vietnam’s newly-won
                        independence remained free of the dictates of any of the great powers. This
                        applied not only to the communist nations, which Diem perceived to be acting
                        through Ho Chi Minh, but the Republic of Vietnam’s ally, the United States.
                        The reality of the matter was that the RVN could not have survived without
                        the economic and military support of the United States. And Diem bristled at
                        the neocolonial implications of this.</p>
                    <p>Community development’s reliance on indigenous human and material resources,
                        Diem hoped, could shield his country from any overt American influence in
                        the nation-building process. Diem believed the Vietnamese people had proven
                        they were uniquely disposed to achieve these aims. Speaking before the South
                        Korean National Assembly in September 1957 – and I am paraphrasing here –
                        Diem argued that, just as their ancestors had acted in the great crises of
                        Vietnamese history, the current generation had, quote, “subdued quickly and
                        with determination the post-colonial anarchy,” end quote, that had
                        threatened the tasks of, quote, “political and economic reconstruction.”</p>
                    <p>Now, Diem attributed this strength of character to Vietnam’s, quote,
                        “concrete cultural traditions.” And these traditions could be found in a
                        pre-colonial democratic and autonomous village spirit that Diem believed had
                        formed the foundation of the Vietnamese way of life and met the economic
                        conditions of its time. Now, through community development, Diem intended to
                        tap these deep roots, to rebuild South Vietnamese society, and achieve the
                        industrialization and unification of his country.</p>
                    <p>Now, by 1957, the Eisenhower Administration’s policy was to support the Diem
                        regime and help to build a noncommunist state around it. The individuals who
                        set policy believed that their country was uniquely suited to do this. As
                        scholars such as Robert Pakenham and Emily Rosenberg have demonstrated, many
                        Americans at the midpoint of the twentieth century possessed the conception
                        of their nation’s developmental history that held that the American people
                        as a whole had enjoyed relatively uninterrupted economic development with
                        considerable ease. They saw this development as unique and exceptional. It
                        was not exploitative but was conceived as liberating and democratic, and
                        therefore, they assumed, a universal model that others could emulate.</p>
                    <p>Now, an undated memorandum drafted around this time for President
                        Eisenhower’s signature, clearly articulated this belief. In it, he argues
                        that the developing nations would, quote, “find much of value to their own
                        situation in the methods developed out of the American experience,” end
                        quote, particularly as the United States had dedicated itself to, quote,
                        “finding techniques of economic and social advance which do not compel the
                        sacrifice of freedom of choice or freedom of opportunity,” end quote.</p>
                    <p>At the time, however, the prevailing mood in Washington was for retrenchment
                        in foreign aid. Eisenhower’s new-look policy emphasized the downloading of
                        defense costs to its allies, and in the case of Vietnam, discouraged any
                        spending on aid programs that might place excessive demands on Vietnam’s
                        limited budgetary resources. Community development was seen as a local
                        matter. It was not consistent with the overall direction of America’s
                        foreign aid policy. And Eisenhower’s advisors felt his government should
                        have as little involvement as possible with the program if it was not
                        conducive to their interests.</p>
                    <p>Now, between 1957 and 1961, the cadres of Ngo Dinh Diem’s Special
                        Commissariat for Civic Action attempted to implement community development
                        throughout the countryside. For reasons I can address during the discussion,
                        the cadres of the Special Commissariat found the ideals behind community
                        development failed to gain sufficient traction among the peasantry to ward
                        off the challenge posed to Diem’s legitimacy by the communist-led
                        insurgency.</p>
                    <p>By 1961, following the establishment of the National Front for the Liberation
                        of South Vietnam, the escalation of organized violence in the countryside
                        forced the Diem government to take more drastic measures to gain the
                        allegiance of the peasantry. Placed under the supervision of Diem’s brother,
                        Ngo Dinh Nhu, the Strategic Hamlet Program attempted to fortify all of the
                        Republic of Vietnam’s 16,000 hamlets, and mobilize the insurgent – or,
                        sorry, the inhabitants – to take responsibility for their own security
                        against the communist-led insurgency.</p>
                    <p>Now more than just a security measure, the Strategic Hamlet Program appears
                        in many ways to have been a means to implement community development amidst
                        a more sustained insurgency. The Ngos thought that the Vietnamese people had
                        to bear the primary responsibility for developing their economy, just as
                        they did for providing local defense. Nhu emphasized small economic
                        projects, such as cottage industries, that required little external support
                        and could generate revenue to pay for hamlet and village administration. Not
                        only would this ease the pressure on an already over-stretched central
                        government to come up with the resources for such an undertaking, but by
                        shifting the burden onto the people, it would instill them with a vested
                        interest in its success. The strategic hamlets, in the word of – in the
                        words of Phillip Catton, represented an attempt to harness the latent energy
                        that supposedly existed in these corporate communities for the greater task
                        of nation-building.</p>
                    <p>And while the Strategic Hamlet Program was in the works, the American
                        commitment to South Vietnam deepened considerably. As part of this new
                        commitment, Kennedy and his advisors advocated a greater American
                        involvement in nation-building. They were influenced by modernization
                        theory, a model for development emerging from the Academy of Social
                        Sciences. Now, modernization theory reflected an interest in the architects
                        of American foreign policy and a more scientific approach to combating
                        communism in the developing world. And this theory, in the words of Nils
                        Gilman, attempted to chart the social, economic, and technological process
                        of progressive historical change between societies defined as traditional
                        and modern. Now, it borrowed from evolutionary theory by arguing that
                        traditional societies followed a unidirectional path toward modernity
                        through a series of progressive phases. When this was combined with the
                        assumptions that underpin the liberal developmentalism of the Eisenhower
                        era, the United States was seen by modernization theorists as a prototypical
                        modern state whose developmental history offered a set of benchmarks against
                        which all other societies could be compared.</p>
                    <p>Now, modernization theorists contended that this process could be
                        dramatically accelerated through contact with developed societies, warning
                        that any developed nation, including a communist one, could intervene in the
                        develop – or in the modernization process, and potentially direct it toward
                        its own ends. And they believed that it was the mission of the United States
                        to step in at this vulnerable stage and protect the independence of the
                        revolutionary modernization process going forward.</p>
                    <p>Now, one individual who was clearly influenced by this thinking was the <lb/>
                        Director of the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and
                        later as Secretary of State for – Assistant Secretary of State for Far
                        Eastern Affairs, Roger Hilsman. In November 1961, he oversaw a study
                        entitled Internal Warfare and Security of the Underdeveloped States. And
                        this study argued that the rural populations of underdeveloped lands were
                        beginning to experience an increase in political consciousness and a
                        mounting restiveness which made them vulnerable to the subversive apparatus
                        of a revolution by export. Communists would specifically target these
                        societies to manipulate these conditions, pressures, and demands, to
                        demoralize the population, and set the government against its people. If,
                        the study continued, the government’s efforts to modernize are neither great
                        nor rapid enough to meet popular demands, the communists could easily try to
                        gain physical control of an entire region and then move from terror and
                        guerrilla tactics to full-scale civil war.</p>
                    <p>The following February, he put together a strategic concept for Vietnam which
                        aimed to defeat the insurgency through a combination of military, political,
                        economic, and social measures. Integral to the plan was the Strategic Hamlet
                        Program. Hilsman envisioned gradually extending the zones of strategic
                        hamlets throughout the countryside like an ink blot. Equally as important
                        were the civic action teams. They appear to accord with what Hilsman called
                        a, quote, “national cadre who would serve as reformers that could become the
                        basis for modernization,” ultimately contributing to a long-range
                        development plan to help Vietnam press ahead to an era of self-sustaining
                        economic growth, once the communist menace had been brought under
                        control.</p>
                    <p>Now despite the similarities in their objectives, the exceptionalist notions
                        that underpin the respective nation-building paradigms of the Diem regime
                        and the Kennedy Administration tended to hinder close cooperation in the
                        Strategic Hamlet Program’s implementation, at least at the official level.
                        Now, Americans were concerned about the manner in which the Strategic Hamlet
                        Program was being implemented. They felt it was haphazard and at times
                        heavy-handed. They feared that its emphasis on self-reliance placed undue
                        hardship on the peasantry at a time when the regime needed to demonstrate
                        what it, quote, “could do to help the people” rather than emphasize, quote,
                        “what the people should do for the government.”</p>
                    <p>But the American concerns miss the point of the program, as far as the Palace
                        was concerned. For Diem, self-reliant strategic hamlets exemplified the much
                        larger nation-building effort he was attempting to carry out. Diem viewed
                        self-reliance as both a virtue and a necessity. It was virtuous because the
                        Palace believed, in the words of Phillip Catton, that a people forced to
                        rely on their own resources would develop the inner strength and common
                        bonds of unity necessary to build a new society and it was necessary, given
                        South Vietnam’s budget restrictions and the government’s reluctance to rely
                        on foreign aid.</p>
                    <p>Now, as this paper has demonstrated or endeavored to demonstrate, both the
                        Ngos and the officials in the American Government had exceptionalist notions
                        of their respective countries’ past that influenced their prescriptions for
                        nation-building in the Republic of Vietnam. Both sides shared a practical
                        belief that their model of development, if properly applied, could undermine
                        the communist-led insurgency and create a viable, modern, noncommunist state
                        by demonstrating to the people of South Vietnam that they had more to gain
                        by siding with their government than its opponents.</p>
                    <p>But beyond that, their conceptions diverged significantly. For the Ngos, the
                        conception of development was articulated in community development, and
                        later the Strategic Hamlet Program. The Ngos anticipated community
                        development harnessing the power of Vietnam’s economic, human, and material
                        resources for the process of vaulting a country into a greater – or into an
                        era of greater economic self-sufficiency. This would reduce their dependence
                        on their foremost ally, the United States, and allow the Republic of Vietnam
                        to maintain its political and economic independence in the international
                        realm. They believed that their village traditions of democracy and autonomy
                        made the Vietnamese people suitably disposed to achieve these aims.</p>
                    <p>For many Americans, particularly those in Washington, the conception was
                        realized in modernization theory. American policymakers like Roger Hilsman
                        believed the United States was uniquely suited to lead the people of the
                        developing world into modernity in a complex international environment. Now
                        in fairness, American foreign policymakers were largely oblivious to the
                        imperialistic tendencies of their actions. They believed that the United
                        States had a model of developmental assistance that, through its
                        benevolence, not only lacked the stigma of colonialism but would be welcomed
                        by their Vietnamese allies. But what the concerned policymakers failed to
                        realize was that the model of development that was guiding their actions was
                        fundamentally incompatible with the broader Vietnamese desire, or South
                        Vietnamese desire, of maintaining a free hand in directing Vietnam’s
                        political, economic, and national development.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. KODOSKY:</hi> Thank you for having me, and thank you
                        all for coming out in the midst of the rainy season here in Washington DC
                        all of the sudden.</p>
                    <p>When I tell students I study American psychological operations, or psy-op,
                        it’s always the same. I get peppered with questions about men who stare at
                        goats. (Laughter.) Of course, getting any reaction from undergraduates, no
                        matter how misguided, constitutes a victory for history professors
                        everywhere. (Laughter.) Besides, M.E. Roberts reports in <hi rend="italic"
                            >Villages of the Moon</hi> , that while deployed to Afghanistan with the
                        345th Psy-Op, he received similar questions about his unit’s work from other
                        soldiers who wanted to know about Jedi mind tricks.</p>
                    <p>Psy-op is really less mysterious than it is often imagined. It has little to
                        do with mental telepathy of either the barnyard or the galactic variety. Its
                        practitioners convey information selectively to influence others in support
                        of national objectives. Psy-op covets hearts and minds and acquires them
                        with persuasion. It serves the military as a force multiplier. It withdraws
                        from the ranks of adversaries and adds to the bank of support. Both parts of
                        the equation, deficit by defection and deposit by winning hearts and minds,
                        are vital for success. Defectors can be counted. Hearts and minds are hard
                        to measure. Psy-op that emphasizes the former over the latter for the sake
                        of expediency, as happened in Vietnam, has all the worth of a one-sided
                        coin.</p>
                    <p>Still, its study retains value for Afghanistan. There, President Hamid Karzai
                        announced in January that the time had arrived to forgive and to forget. The
                        Afghan Peace and Reintegration Program, or PARP, targets both foot soldiers
                        and the leadership of the Taliban. It offers insurgents cash, amnesty, and
                        jobs, and it promises reconciliation with the Taliban’s leadership. Afghan
                        officials call PARP the main pillar for bringing peace to Afghanistan. It
                        offers an honorable place in society, the program does, for those who are
                        willing to renounce violence, respect the Afghan constitution, while cutting
                        ties with al-Qaida. British Foreign Minister David Miliband cited PARP as
                        part of a civilian surge, aimed at reaching Afghan hearts and minds.
                        American Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates echoed the endorsement,
                        suggesting that there could well be a surge of such followers willing to be
                        integrated into Afghan society.</p>
                    <p>Whether Karzai’s plan works depends on the ability of its architects to
                        incorporate the lessons provided by Dai Doan Ket, dubbed national
                        reconciliation by American officials. Republic of Vietnam Prime Minister
                        Nguyen Cao Ky instituted Dai Doan Ket by proclamation on the 19th of April,
                        1967. It intended to reinvigorate the defector program in place since 1963,
                        known as Chieu Hoi. While Chieu Hoi had targeted foot soldiers, the new
                        initiative promised government aid in finding careers for top-level
                        defectors. Further, it offered full participation in political activities to
                        all who agreed to renounce force, abandon communism, lay down their weapons,
                        and abide by the constitution of Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Proponents of Dai Doan Ket envisioned national reconciliation as a means to
                        ending the war by nation-building. It failed to realize that promise. The
                        number of high-level defectors remained minimal. For example, the Army of
                        the Republic of Vietnam, or ARVN, offered ex-Viet Cong officers the chance
                        to take examinations that would enable them to join the military at their
                        old ranks. By 1971, the tests remained un-administered. Nobody volunteered
                        to take them. That same year, Viet Cong agents posing as defectors,
                        infiltrated the program in record numbers and overran 31 outposts. In fact,
                        little enthusiasm ever existed for national reconciliation outside of
                        WashingtonDC. American officials, under increasing pressure to demonstrate
                        non-military progress in Vietnam, pressured Republic of Vietnam officials
                        into extending an olive branch to their enemies.</p>
                    <p>Twenty-third of November 1966, Ogden Williams, who was the American director
                        for Chieu Hoi, met with his ARVN counterpart, Colonel Pham Anh. The
                        Vietnamese colonel appeared somewhat jolted by confronting the magnitude of
                        the program, which was national reconciliation, that Williams presented him.
                        He also posed a very significant question. Was this national reconciliation
                        a Vietnamese idea or an American idea? Good question, indeed one that
                        Williams understood required the correct answer. Williams went on to
                        convince Anh that in fact, the idea had originated with Anh himself in
                        response to a question about how to reenergize Chieu Hoi. Williams too told
                        Anh that his suggestion became the basis for discussion between top American
                        officials and top Republic of Vietnam officials before and during the
                        conference in Manila.</p>
                    <p>Williams reported back to Washington that Anh now seemed reassured. Williams
                        saw this as a good thing, reporting that, contrary to what Washington may
                        think or claim, it is most important that this program be considered by the
                        Vietnamese as being their own idea. Williams’s sales job actually began
                        several months earlier in the office of the United States
                        Ambassador-at-large Averell W. Harriman, where his negotiations committee
                        met under direction from President Johnson, to search for a negotiated
                        settlement in Vietnam, meeting for the first time on the 2nd of August in
                        1966. The committee speculated that a meaningful amnesty offer could open up
                        the possibility of National Liberation Front leadership returning to
                        political life in the South. It recognized that there would be considerable
                        resistance in Saigon, both on the part of the Republic of Vietnam’s military
                        and the American Embassy, for this idea. And it turned its attention to how
                        the idea could be sold in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>The impetus for the enthusiasm about the amnesty offer in the first place
                        came from a report presented to Harriman earlier in the day by Henry
                        Kissinger, who had just returned from Vietnam. Kissinger reported that
                        American strategy there was wrong. Kissinger contended that the task
                        remained to break the link between the guerrillas and villagers, a slow,
                        hard job which did not appeal to the generals in Saigon. He advocated that
                        an amnesty offer by the Republic of Vietnam would be useful and should
                        precede any serious effort by the Republic of Vietnam to engage in talks
                        with the National Liberation Front, or the Viet Cong.</p>
                    <p>Kissinger was persuasive. Harriman’s group, which officially signed on to the
                        idea later in that day, began pushing it up the ladder. Harriman reported to
                        Johnson and Secretary of State Dean Rusk on the 18th of August that, as a
                        result of previous consideration, and particularly Kissinger’s talk in Viet
                        – talks in Vietnam, the negotiations committee began taking several steps
                        toward possible eventual reconciliation between substantial elements of the
                        Viet Cong and the Republic of Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>The Johnson Administration embraced the idea as a means to produce an
                        accelerated disintegration of the Viet Cong. Still, the idea hardly met with
                        an enthusiastic reaction in Vietnam. Ky labeled the proposal as premature.
                        He contended that such an appeal could adversely affect the morale of the
                        South Vietnamese troops, who would see their enemies being accepted back
                        before they were defeated. Ky worried that national reconciliation could
                        pretty well eliminate the ARVN fighting capacity. Nguyen Van Thieu observed
                        that over the years, Chieu Hoi has not had a very powerful effect.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge cabled these concerns back to Washington and
                        warned that there was a pace at which things could be done in Vietnam.
                        Lodge’s words of caution went unheeded in Washington, where officials had
                        already put the cart in front of the horse. Johnson’s special assistant,
                        Robert W. Komer, identified that mounting a massive national reconciliation
                        campaign deserves top billing – backing. And he advised Johnson to press
                        both Ky and Thieu to stand up and say the right things at Manila.</p>
                    <p>American officials received the pledge they sought from the Republic of
                        Vietnam officials at Manila to promote national reconciliation, and they
                        garnered little more for the next six months. Washington forged ahead
                        nonetheless, and American officials in Saigon followed. Chieu Hoi Director
                        Williams wrote Richard Holbrooke on the White House staff that he had
                        pressed for a special decree to extend voting rights to defectors, largely
                        with international opinion in mind. This happened despite Kissinger’s own
                        admission, during his trip to Vietnam in July of 1966, that the problem of
                        how to establish effective civil administration remained unresolved in
                        Vietnam. Consequently, any promise that the Republic of Vietnam made to
                        defectors remained hollow.</p>
                    <p>The existing status of Chieu Hoi, three years after its beginning, did not
                        bode well for national reconciliation. Begun at the insistence of American
                        and British advisors in 1963, professor – or Premier Nguyen Cao Ky claimed
                        that Chieu Hoi left him disgusted, indicating that much American money had
                        been wasted. This notion constituted a recurring theme. Thieu expressed
                        concern that of 40,000 defectors brought in through Chieu Hoi, 32,000 were
                        totally out of Republic of Vietnam control. He argued the program lacked the
                        ability to ensure that defectors did not revert to VC. Thieu pointed out
                        that nothing big could be expected in the way of national reconciliation.
                        There remained in Vietnam a widespread suspicion of defectors. He told
                        Ambassador Lodge that when PremierKy recently spoke of National Liberation
                        Front members becoming ministers, he was at once subjected to a tremendous
                        barrage of criticism. Regarding reconciliation, Thieu continued, there
                        should be no illusions.</p>
                    <p>Yet the illusions persisted. That American officials harbored them at all is
                        remarkable, given the numerous problems with Chieu Hoi reported from the
                        field in August of 1966. During a large-scale appeal, once advisor reported,
                        few defectors came in. Another advisor noted that the Chieu Hoi center in
                        Lam Dong Province had been raided by an ARVN battalion. Other reports were
                        equally bleak. One filed from Quang Ngai-Quang Tin indicates that neither
                        province has an effective Chieu Hoi psy-ops team in operation. Another from
                        An Giang cites a marked lack of initiative on the part of the Chieu Hoi
                        chief. An advisor from Tay Ninh-Binh Long inserted that the Chieu Hoi
                        program simply has not been very effective.</p>
                    <p>American policymakers maintained their illusions about Chieu Hoi because they
                        continued to put their faith in numbers, a reflection of the strategy of
                        attrition employed on the military side. Quantity trumped quality every
                        time. Through its entire time of operation, including the period after 1967,
                        when the Republic of Vietnam implemented Dai Doan Ket, the initiative
                        yielded about 200,000 defectors. Yet, as advisors made clear, this metric is
                        misleading. On the surface, the program appears to move along. Defectors
                        come in, but any look below the surface reveals grave problems, one wrote.
                        Specifically, Chieu Hoi activity is not coordinated with other elements. A
                        report filed from Hau Nghia cites a growing number of defectors, double that
                        in April, but observes that the Chieu Hoi office has yet to work out a
                        re-indoctrination program on the most elementary sort. Defectors just sit at
                        the center. Of course, a study to facilitate re-integration into society
                        remains shamefully lacking.</p>
                    <p>Where programs of re-integration did exist, Republic of Vietnam officials
                        dwelt more heavily on the need to kill VC than on the stated Republic of
                        Vietnam goals of peace and prosperity. Lecturers read from prepared texts
                        with little regard as to whether they were even understood, much less
                        accepted. Defectors found Chieu Hoi personnel to be undemocratic and lacking
                        enthusiasm for what they were teaching.</p>
                    <p>A report prepared by the Chieu Hoi Division in 1966 reveals the defector
                        program’s problems as widespread. Citing little, if any, coordination of the
                        Chieu Hoi psy-ops effort with military operations and noting that reception
                        centers had not been built up either quantitatively or qualitatively to the
                        desired standards. Further, the report also identifies a number of cases of
                        mistreatment and labels the political reorientation for returnees as sadly
                        deficient.</p>
                    <p>Dai Doan Ket didn’t fix this. In 1968, American advisors cited Vietnamese
                        motivation and administrative capability as the program’s continued problems
                        of ultimate concern. There existed still a continued attitude of suspicion
                        among people living in the Republic of Vietnam that inhibits resettlement
                        and reintegration of returnees. In fact, the more Dai Doan Ket promised, the
                        worse the situation became. Suspicion turned to resentment whenever the
                        program offered any extra advantages to ex-Viet Cong. The program risks
                        becoming extremely counterproductive, in the words of American advisors, to
                        the entire war effort if returnees are not successfully reintegrated into
                        Vietnamese economic life, especially as finding jobs for Hoi Chanhs, or
                        defectors, remained a major specific problem.</p>
                    <p>The Republic of Vietnam had already authorized the establishment of
                        high-level provincial committees to find jobs for Hoi Chanhs. By the end of
                        1971, though, only five provinces had such a committee. At the national
                        level, the Chieu Hoi Ministry provided jobs to several prominent returnees,
                        but other civil ministries demonstrated no initiative or desire to make
                        national reconciliation a reality. Neither did the United States. American
                        Embassy officials applied rigorous rules to prevent American agencies from
                        hiring defectors, thwarting the efforts to do so on several occasions by
                        both the Joint United States Public Affairs Office and the United States
                        Agency for International Development. United States security regulations
                        inhibited the employment of returnees as laborers, drivers, and in other
                        non-sensitive positions. Getting embassy security clearances for former
                        nationalist Viet Minh was difficult, while the problem of – was even greater
                        for ex-Viet Cong. The Chieu Hoi Division saw this as critical, particularly
                        as a former employee of the colonial regime had no difficulty whatsoever
                        receiving clearance.</p>
                    <p>By 1973, former Chieu Hoi field officer J.A. Koch noted that the tendency of
                        the bureaucracy is to body count the returnee as he comes in the door, then
                        to lose interest in his further activities and welfare. The economic
                        livelihood of the ex-enemy is far from assured. There had yet to transpire
                        within the RVN by this late date the development of Chieu Hoi into a dynamic
                        and effective national reconciliation movement.</p>
                    <p>National reconciliation, despite the repeated proclamations of Dai Doan Ket
                        issued by RVN leaders remained an American-conceived promise disconnected
                        from the reality of Vietnam. As implemented through Chieu Hoi, it never
                        received a genuine endorsement from Vietnamese. Through the coordination of
                        American firepower and psy-op, both delivered in massive quantities,
                        defections occurred regularly. The RVN did little to accommodate those who
                        rallied, however, and offered little to attract Hoi Chanh in the first
                        place. They presented Chieu Hoi officials with their greatest challenge
                        because the program could only sell the image that existed of the Republic
                        of Vietnam. Without genuine attempts to reform widespread RVN corruption and
                        apathy, Chieu Hoi held little appeal to Viet Cong on an ideological or
                        political level. This suggests why American psy-op generated to support the
                        defector program largely emphasized fear, hardship, et cetera. It had few
                        positives to offer.</p>
                    <p>The president’s special counsel at the time, Harry McPherson, identified
                        these issues when he visited Vietnam following the Dai Doan Ket Proclamation
                        that summer. He warned Johnson that the VC take every advantage of the
                        hatred caused by Republic of Vietnam corruption and by the absence of
                        government services. McPherson admitted that while it sounds romantic to
                        say, if he were a young peasant and saw that the ridiculous Vietnamese
                        educational system offered him few opportunities, and the RVN had provided
                        him no reason to have it, if given a position of leadership in the VC, he
                        would join up.</p>
                    <p>The communists had little to offer in a positive way either. Their basic
                        appeal, though, targeted those who wanted to get rid of the system today. It
                        proved sufficient, however, to thwart any promise made by Dai Doan Ket for
                        national reconciliation in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>Thank you. (Applause.).</p>

                    <p>Professor Journaud.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. JOURNAUD:</hi> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you
                        very much to the organizers for inviting us with my French colleagues, and
                        to have the great honor and pleasure to participate in such a fascinating
                        conference.</p>
                    <p>I would not want to apologize for being French except to acknowledge our
                        sadly well-known reluctance to speak foreign languages. One of the
                        explanations, if not excuses, might be related to the difficulty to – for a
                        French person to be fluent in his own language. I must confess that I’m
                        still learning French, so pardon my mistakes, please. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>I presume that the organizers have chosen a French scholar to comment on this
                        particular panel, having in mind the French experience of the Indochina war,
                        and especially the experience of a counterinsurgent program that some French
                        officials established during the Indochina war and intensified in the
                        Algerian War, and further developed in Africa.</p>
                    <p>Let me underline briefly a strange paradox. As you know, a few French
                        officials, like Roger Trinquier or David Galula and experts like Bernard
                        Fall, who was French, by the way, tried to share their knowledge of this
                        field with their American counterparts at the very beginning of the Vietnam
                        War. At the same time, however, they were marginalized in France by de
                        Gaulle and his government, due to the disastrous politicization of the army
                        during the Algerian War, due as well to the priority given by General de
                        Gaulle to the construction of a nuclear deterrent, and due, finally, to his
                        conviction, personal conviction, that Vietnam required a political solution,
                        not a military one.</p>
                    <p>First, I will develop some brief – briefly remark – general remarks and
                        sometimes critiques, hoping that it will be constructive. And then, if I
                        have time enough, a few questions.</p>
                    <p>First of all, I have been impressed by the richness of the sources used by
                        our four presenters, thanks to the privilege of reading their papers before
                        the conference – North American and French archives, interviews, the press,
                        and of course, a wonderful <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> . As a permanent
                        construction and reconstruction, the past needs to be explored with new
                        materials, and our four researchers have proven to be very use – efficient,
                        sorry, in this quest.</p>
                    <p>Despite real difficulties in locating some archival material relating to the
                        secret services in France, because specific SDECE’s series are completely
                        closed in France, Élie and Jean-Marc have succeeded in demonstrating the
                        reality of cooperation between French and American secret services in the
                        fields of intelligence and COIN. Even more interestingly, their so described
                        ambivalence of this cooperation, which sometimes led – leads to a covert or
                        silent war between the two allies. In their reconstruction of the genealogy
                        of pacification and COIN programs, Jean-Marc and Élie demonstrate an acute
                        grasp of Franco-American exchanges and interactions which are still active
                        nowadays. I think that they provide a very interesting way of better
                        understanding the complexity of this particular French-American
                        engagement.</p>
                    <p>Historians can contribute in drawing a more accurate picture of these
                        relations, too often reduced, I think, to simple positions and crises and
                        too often used for negative political purposes, as we saw in 2003. I
                        modestly tried to move along this path in my PhD dissertation, describing
                        the survival of strong links among some diplomats, intellectuals, and
                        experts from both our countries during the Vietnam War and demonstrating the
                        sometimes efficient cooperation that they sometimes strove to develop in the
                        secret peace process.</p>
                    <p>Geoffrey Stewart and Robert Kodosky exemplify this recent tendency within
                        North American historiography, which aims to revisit the South Vietnamese
                        quest for autonomy from USA, motivations, divisions, goals, and objectives,
                        as Professor Brigham brilliantly did a few years ago, followed by Edward
                        Miller and some others.</p>
                    <p>I found very interesting the link that the organizers have made between COIN,
                        reconstruction, and reconciliation, a link which has never well articulated,
                        whether during or after the Vietnam War. It focuses on the heart of the
                        problem faced by the leadership during the Indochina wars and, of course,
                        confronting today by a new generation of American political and military
                        leadership in Iraq and Afghanistan. I mean, the political problem, the
                        political foundation of the states, the social structure of South Vietnam,
                        the sensitive question of legitimacy of the state that the French and then
                        the American has tried to build on their attempts (inaudible).</p>
                    <p>Historians have to be clear, I think, about the origins of local
                        insurgencies, without which there would be no foreign – no need for outside
                        military intervention. Most historians agree today that the roots of the
                        insurgency in South Vietnam are located in the violent anticommunist
                        repression launched by Diem beginning in 1957, which contradict, of course,
                        the official principle that the regime was always invoking among others the
                        respect of the human person. The French expert Philippe Devillers
                        demonstrated this very convincingly as soon as 1962. In order to understand
                        the failure or the success of COIN programs, historians also need to study
                        very precisely the context and interactions between the political, the
                        economic, the social, and the cultural aspects of insurrection.</p>
                    <p>Even in the military field, they must study counter-insurrection in its
                        relation to conventional operations. We know, for example, that
                        search-and-destroy missions and counteroffensives after the Tet 1968 proved
                        very detrimental to the pacification efforts because of the indiscriminate
                        use of power and followed by American and allied troops throughout
                        (inaudible) South Vietnamese civilians. COIN programs generated massive
                        population displacement, and pacification became linked to occupation.</p>
                    <p>Galula, as early as 1963, and many others pointed out that population and not
                        territory is the center of gravity of counterinsurgency. But the
                        population’s motivations were not deeply studied by these authors, as some
                        analysts like Daniel Ellsberg or David Elliott would do it later. Historians
                        have the right and, I risk adding, the duty to continue their approach
                        because they understand how false lessons can drive people motivated with
                        the best intentions. As David Elliott wrote in 2007, each – quote, “Each
                        insurgency has a distinctive political and socioeconomic character, which
                        usually renders the tool-kit approach ineffective or irrelevant.” From this
                        point of view, the historian of this panel, especially the French ones,
                        would be wisely advised to go deeper into the analysis of these centers of
                        gravity.</p>
                    <p>Let me offer a few illustrations. The Franco-American idea of GCMA mentioned
                        by Élie and Jean-Marc was presented at that time without any precise idea of
                        the history of relations between the loyal Vietnamese troops and the ethnic
                        minorities that were used by the French, and then by the Americans, against
                        other Vietnamese, namely the Viet Minh and the Viet Cong. We know the long
                        history of both conflicts and cooperation between Vietnamese and so-called
                        Montagnards, and the later were divided among themselves. We know of
                        dramatic consequences of some of these – for some of these minority groups,
                        such as the Hmong, armed and radicalized in their antagonism against
                        Vietnamese or Lao communists and within their own community before being
                        abandoned under disastrous conditions by the French and then the Americans.
                        We should analyze this program within the local context and complexity of
                        relationship between minorities and between Vietnamese and minorities.</p>
                    <p>Second, the motivations of the population have often been ignored and
                        misrepresented. To say that most of the population will be neutral in the
                        conflict, support of the masses can be obtained with the aid of an active,
                        friendly minority, as Galula has written, and as many French and American
                        official asserted during the Indochina wars, as we have seen in some of the
                        papers today, is, I think, nonsense. All the French, American, and
                        Vietnamese reports that I’ve been able to read confirm that in 1964 and
                        1967, most of the South Vietnamese population was tired of the war and ready
                        to accept a mutual solution as permitted by de Gaulle. I personally think
                        that no COIN program could have succeeded for this reason, but it’s – okay,
                        it’s my point of view. The choice of war was one of a minority devoted to
                        protecting its own narrow interests against the desire for peace and
                        neutrality felt by the majority.</p>
                    <p>Let me move quickly on some more specific points. Élie has told us that
                        French-American relations in Indochina were a necessary but unwanted
                        alliance, a reluctant alliance. I think that this appreciation should be
                        nuanced. Many among French political and military elites, even de Gualle
                        itself of the early ’50s, favored a strong alliance with the USA in
                        Indochina. Mostly for financial reasons, by the way. This has been
                        intensively studied by historians like Laurent Cesari, Hugues Tertrais, and
                        Mark Lawrence in particular.</p>
                    <p>Likewise, the orthodox Western perspective, as Geoffrey Stewart wrote in his
                        paper, portrays Diem as an American creation or even an invention of
                        Landsdale. I think that it is time to break with this very American-centered
                        and perhaps CIA-centered vision. Please don’t forget the French actor. Diem
                        could not have become prime minister without the agreement of the French
                        Government at that time and the active support that he has garnered from
                        important members of the French elite, some linked with the personalist
                        networks, others close to Diem or Nhu.</p>
                    <p>Diem then authorized and sometimes favored the survival of very important
                        economic and cultural French interests in South Vietnam. Even in the
                        military field, he asked for French documentation about the Algerian War
                        before seeking of <hi rend="italic">rapproachment</hi> with Paris in the
                        early ’60s.</p>
                    <p>If I have two or three minutes, I can – yeah, ask a few questions to the
                        panelists. First of all, Jean-Marc and maybe Élie, in 1944 and ’45, there
                        was a split between – among French – between those who wanted to maintain
                        colonial or neo-colonial control more or less along the line of de Gualle’s
                        policy and those who were called New French, so named because they had
                        fought in the resistance, come to Vietnam with a new way of thinking. The
                        New French realized the power of an appeal of nationalism, even when
                        absorbed into communism, as OSS agents did at that time. And I think
                        especially about the Mission Five under Jean Sainteny’s responsibility. What
                        became of these New French agents during the Indochina War and maybe
                        later?</p>
                    <p>For all of you, maybe, could you recall for us the French origins of the
                        strategic hamlets that Geoffrey told us about? Maybe more for Geoffrey
                        Stewart and Robert Kodoksy, what were the main results for the five-year
                        plan for economic development and the social progress promoted by Diem in
                        1957? What were the main sources of inspiration of the Diem economic and
                        social program? I know some French experts from the École Polytechnic and
                        the <hi rend="italic">Economy and Humanism Association</hi> were involved in
                        the search for a viable economic program, standing somewhere between
                        capitalism and communism. And – but this has never been studied. I don’t
                        know if you have some information about that.</p>
                    <p>And the last question, I know it’s a very huge question – I’m sorry for that
                        – but how such government as that of South Vietnam, born in the late ’40s,
                        dominated by a miniscule business class, a <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie
                            d’affaires</hi> , which was in truth not well interested in the fate of
                        the vast peasant majority, a government which only survived thanks to
                        foreign aid, a government that became dominated by a military elite
                        dedicated to the pursuits of war in 1965. How could such a government have
                        made peace? Would not negotiation, coalition, or reconciliation have been
                        suicidal for those who followed Diem?</p>
                    <p>If I might had a few words in conclusion, I would suggest that if lessons can
                        be and must be drawn from history to a level, tactical, strategic, and
                        political, it also teaches us that valuable lessons, whether deliberately or
                        not, can be quickly forgotten by the leaders. As Richard Goodwin, the former
                        speechwriter of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, wrote, “History is an
                        enigmatic teacher, a trickster, whose only certain lesson is that the future
                        cannot count on the past.” But the man of character, the world historical
                        personality, according to Hegel, is he who attends the penetrating
                        understanding of history and simultaneously turns toward the future, moves
                        freely within the singularity of events and sizes up moments favorable to
                        his goal.</p>
                    <p>Evidently, in the period and place examined in this fascinating panel, the
                        men of character remain in the communist camp. In the early ’40s, at least,
                        they were engaged both in a total war and a huge effort to rebuild an <hi

                        domination.</p>

                        audience, do any of the panelists want to respond to the questions that were
                        posed?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">Mr. TENENBAUM:</hi> Let me just shortly –</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. HUNT:</hi> Sure. Briefly, that is.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">MR. TENENBAUM:</hi> Yeah. As briefly as possible. On
                        concerning New French, that’s true that there has been those French from the
                        resistance who’ve been replacing actually in ’44-45 the old colonials who
                        had been on the overall loyal to Vichy. But then the problem – I mean, it’s
                        interesting to see in, specifically on terms of, for instance, guerrilla
                        questions, that those New French had this joint background with the
                        Americans and the British because they were allied to London at the time. So
                        maybe this is how they influenced the way the war was viewed at the time,
                        whereas the Old French, as we can say that, who had been loyal to Vichy had
                        – were more embedded in a more colonial fashion. And that’s how those New
                        French were maybe less colonial. And that’s how maybe we can see that the
                        French were as something that the New French – I mean, we have to be very
                        careful about that because it was a very restrictive number of people, so
                        –</p>
                    <p>But to some extent, it brought less colonial vision to the war. Maybe
                        Jean-Marc wants to talk about a little bit of the strategy gamble. We have
                        to see that the strategy gamble is mainly a British influence. I mean, the
                        French did influence to some extent because of the gamble. Maybe Jean-Marc
                        wants to talk about it. But on the overall, it was Sir Robert Thompson who
                        was mainly at the origin of the strategic hamlets, so he’d have to be
                        considered as mainly a British influence. Maybe we have some examples of a
                        French experience that could have influenced the program, but mainly it was
                        British one.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. LePAGE:</hi> About the pacification, however, we have
                        an evolution between 1951 and 1952. The French authorities search new
                        solutions about pacification because the ancient solution (inaudible)
                        different points were developed. The constitution of the GAMOs, it’s like
                        the civic actions teams during the Vietnam War. And it was, this GAMO, was
                        very successful during the pacification operation in the South Vietnam, in
                        particular, and (inaudible) in North Vietnam. We have different (inaudible).
                        We have the creation in France, in the (inaudible)– excuse me – warfare with
                        the GE-5 bureau of political warfare and in end to develop propaganda. And
                        the U.S.’s transformation of the self defense militia in the model of the
                        original popular troops of the RVDN.</p>
                    <p>And we have two ideas with the French armies. The first, it’s the
                        Vietnamization of the pacification with – because, for example, there’s the
                        GAMO, was totally Vietnamese. And in the other end, you have in the same
                        time acculturation of the French Expeditionary Corps, who adopted the local
                        RDVN warfare, yes, in pacification.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. STEWART:</hi> I’ll be brief and try to address the –
                        I think I basically got three questions here. The first were what were the
                        results of the five-year plan, or Diem’s five-year plan, which the community
                        development was part of? What were the main sources of this economic
                        program? And how did a regime like the Diem regime think it could get
                        support?</p>
                    <p>Okay, well, the first one, the results of the five-year plan, in a nutshell,
                        it was never really realized just with the insurgency and then Diem himself
                        getting deposed, though he was – and I think Ed Miller could probably
                        address this a little better than I could – but I get the impression that
                        some economic development, some industrialization, was occurring in the
                        South during this time, but never to the degree that Diem would have liked
                        or to make the country anything near self-reliant.</p>
                    <p>Now, the sources of the five-year plan, that is a very good question and
                        that’s something that needs a lot more work. What I can see is basically two
                        influences here. The first one is clearly the doctrine or the ideology of
                        personalism, this idea of what Ed Miller was talking about earlier, kind of
                        a – almost a – might’ve – be between kind of a compromise or towing the line
                        between liberal capitalism and communism as well as it does seem that they
                        were a little bit influenced by Walt Rostow’s modernization theory or his
                        development of it during the 1950s.</p>
                    <p>And then finally, how did the Diem regime think it could gain support? That’s
                        a very good question. I do believe that Diem thought he had the best
                        interests of the people at heart, but just his methodology didn’t work. And
                        I think his – the personalism, the ideas behind this were trying to use
                        Vietnam’s material and human resources to develop this country and give
                        people a vested interest in its development, and this would show the people
                        that the government was trying to provide them something, but it clearly
                        wasn’t working.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. HUNT:</hi> Questions from the audience?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> I just want to clarify a couple of things.
                        One is that the Chieu Hoi program, while I was responsible in many ways for
                        getting it started – yeah – can you hear me? The Chieu Hoi program, while I
                        was responsible for getting it started, was not an American or a British
                        idea. It was actually a Vietnamese idea. And they were the ones that decided
                        what the program was going to consist of. It had simply bogged down
                        bureaucratically and nobody was actually planning on it. So that’s how it
                        got started. So the notion it was somehow an American program imposed on the
                        Vietnamese is absolutely incorrect.</p>
                    <p>In terms of the development of, or the imposition of American ideas or the
                        difference between American ideas, I can tell you that there was a
                        considerable difference between American ideas on the ground and American
                        ideas in Washington. And the American ideas on the ground, since I was
                        responsible for a lot of them in counterinsurgency, were related to what the
                        Vietnamese were trying to do, to try to assist that. And I think you need to
                        modify that a bit.</p>
                    <p>On French-American relations, nobody mentioned Paul Mus, who was a very key
                        figure.</p>
                    <p>The other thing is that – yeah, the other thing is – sorry, I tend to gesture
                        when I – (laughter) – the other thing that I would – and I don’t think you
                        adequately – any of you adequately addressed is the fact that France failed,
                        after many repeated attempts by the Vietnamese, to give the Vietnamese real
                        independence. And that was a tremendous underlying factor in the failure of
                        what we were trying to do. And that was also the cause of a lot of
                        difference between the Americans and the French.</p>
                    <p>Back in 1951, or 1950, De Lattre told Mr. Blum -- he said you are the most
                        dangerous man in Vietnam. Now this meant conceivably that he was more
                        dangerous than Ho Chi Minh. So you have to take into account, I think, that
                        dynamic when you address the – and I’d love to get some comments on – from
                        any of you on that one.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Just a postscript on the issue of Hoi Chanh
                        and defectors: In the late 1960s and early ’70s, when I was evaluating
                        psychological operations in Vietnam, I found that the fungibility of the
                        categories of defectors and prisoners was such that, on the Vietnamese side,
                        it was very dangerous to ascribe that people had defected. Many, many
                        defectors did not come in in response to a ideological appeal but simply
                        being caught between a rock and a hard place and defect – I’m here, if
                        you’re trying to make eye contact – that’s okay. You were the one who
                        brought up goats earlier, so – (laughter).</p>
                    <p>But what I wanted to point out that was Americans were very judicious.
                        Someone who came in and was tagged as a prisoner remained a prisoner while
                        he was in the American chain. Similar, it was also true of Hoi Chnh. On the
                        South Vietnamese side, people were very often reclassified. That is to say a
                        prisoner who showed signs of collaborating and cooperating would be
                        reclassified as a defector. And a defector who did not prove to be very
                        useful in terms of his intelligence or cooperation would be classified as a
                        prisoner. The result was that the only people who were really coming in as
                        defectors very often were people who were in a tactical situation, caught by
                        the hair on the back of their neck and decided to put up their hands and say
                        Chieu Hoi, although probably not literally. The result was we recommended
                        that in leaflets and other appeals, the term “allow yourself to be captured”
                        was far more acceptable to the North Vietnamese than to say “surrender or
                        defect.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. HUNT:</hi> Another question there?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Yes, I actually have some familiarity with
                        picking up Hoi Chanhs with the river patrol boats and never really sure
                        exactly how valid they really were. All you had to do was have a little
                        leaflet, and of course it was in Vietnamese. And so – but yeah, you could
                        imagine that it would be pretty gutsy to just kind of come up to a river
                        patrol boat armed to the teeth and say, “Hello, I’m ready to turn in –
                        myself in.” So it never did have much confidence in those guys, except that
                        if you could send – get some information out of them that said that there
                        were some enemy someplace, we would convert them immediately to a scout,
                        basically, and take them back out on an operation, which then kind of really
                        hung them out. But since we were hung out ourselves, it really was not much
                        of a difficult decision to do.</p>
                    <p>The numbers that you were citing sounded very, very high compared to what I
                        ever saw. Not that I was there for five years or anything. But still, I
                        think you said 200,000 or something was that number?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. STEWART:</hi> Yeah, actually, the report, I think,
                        puts it at – it’s under 200,000, but it’s 194,500.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Uh-huh.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. STEWART:</hi> But those are highly contested and I
                        think reflect your remarks regarding the classification. The fundamental
                        point, I think, is that the counting was very difficult, the classification
                        was very difficult, and essentially, whether through Chieu Hoi or through
                        Dai Doan Ket, the attempt to reintegrate and make – give some credibility to
                        the promises that were being made -- wasn’t there.</p>
                    <p>The suspicion that you were talking about, I see repeatedly both on the
                        Vietnamese and on the American side. And on the American side, there was a
                        concerted effort, more or less the whole time Chieu Hoi was running, that
                        it’s cheaper to defect a Viet Cong than to kill a Viet Cong and constantly
                        talking about the difficulty of convincing what they called in the document
                        Free World forces, meaning American and allies, of trusting prisoners that
                        they brought in. So it was a constant problem. And constantly, too, in the
                        documents it is the tactical – it’s the American firepower that essentially,
                        in the heat of the moment, brings in defectors. But the defectors, after
                        they come in, the follow-up process very difficult.</p>
                    <p>One of the connections to the Philippines, actually, there were a number of
                        Filipinos who were brought in who were familiar with the process in the
                        Philippines to keep their eyes on the Vietnamese, to try to make – and that
                        ran through the whole program. So that’s one of the things that suggested
                        the sort of Filipino routes. So –</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Well, I would just add that if we got a Hoi
                        Chanhs – and I never saw more than one at a time – and I would say that we
                        also did a lot of psy-ops, usually with speakers playing a tape, and we’d go
                        down the canals and past the little villages and be blaring away with this
                        tape, and people would stare at us like we stepped off a spaceship,
                        practically, except for the kids, who would always come out and wave and
                        cheer and whatnot. It was a big event. But then we would – if we got –
                        picked up a fellow, we would bring him back and it would – eventually wound
                        up – it – the provincial headquarters with the PRU, P-R-U, USAID guys and
                        the Vietnamese Regional Force province people, and then they converted them
                        for intelligence purposes.</p>
                    <p>And as for resettlement, I mean, it was – the chain was broken. I had no clue
                        where these people wound up, so – and I would say that in almost 19 months
                        in country, I guess I would say maybe a handful, four, is about the most I
                        can ever remember. Maybe one or two we were able to convert to an operation,
                        which had ambiguous results anyway. We never really could close down that –
                        it wasn’t like you were going to find a VC hospital or a big cache or
                        something like that.</p>
                    <p>We did a lot of psy-ops, handed out a lot of leaflets. And –</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. STEWART:</hi> Yet the numbers that I’ve seen are
                        staggering, billions in very short pieces of time. But to some degree, I
                        think it was counterproductive in the sense that many people, including
                        within USIA and in JUSPAO, including Barry Zorthian, sort of talking about
                        the need to get out and do face-to-face. But because of the difficulties
                        regarding language and because of the – obviously, it needed to be
                        Vietnamese that were going to be presenting the most credible and legitimate
                        representation of the Republic of Vietnam, it was difficult. So essentially,
                        the response from the American side was to create leaflets. But study after
                        study of people, communications people who went over there and looked, said
                        that the least productive ways to do psy-op are leaflets and loudspeakers.

                        <hi rend="strong">DR. CARLAND:</hi> As we approach late afternoon, as I’ve
                        said before, we’re going to bring the war home. Don Ritchie, Historian of
                        the United States Senate, will chair our last session. It is titled, “Ours
                        to Reason Why: Intervention in Vietnam, Reaction in America.” In the Senate
                        Historical Office, Don has conducted oral histories, edited for publication
                        the executive sessions of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee – which has
                        a lot of wonderful Vietnam stuff, and I’ve enjoyed it – as well as other
                        historical documents and provided reference and research for senators,
                        scholars, and the media. That’s in the Senate world.</p>
                    <p>In the larger world, Don is a legendary raconteur of quality that makes his
                        public addresses always a delight. His books include, <hi rend="italic"
                            >Press Gallery: Congress and the Washington Correspondents</hi>, which
                        won the Leopold Prize from the Organization of American Historians, <hi
                            rend="italic">Reporting from Washington: The History of the Washington
                            Press Corps</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">The U.S. Congress: A Very Short
                            Introduction</hi>. Few political historians are better qualified than
                        Don to put in context the papers to be presented here, papers that range
                        from how we got into Vietnam and to its effect, political and otherwise, on
                        the home front.</p>
                    <p>Don.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. RITCHIE:</hi> Thank you. I want to reiterate what all
                        the other panels have said and that we appreciate John Carland and the
                        Office of the Historian in putting together this extraordinary conference.
                        One of its great strengths is the international quality of the conference,
                        and this panel, I think, will live up to that as well.</p>
                    <p>Every war has a battlefront and a home front. And however you want to
                        interpret the conditions on the battlefront in Vietnam, the policymakers
                        lost the home front. Henry Kissinger opened this conference by stating that
                        we cannot afford a divided a country in going to war. In fact, the
                        policymakers had a united country in going to war. It’s just that during the
                        course of the war, they failed to be able to explain the reasons for the war
                        and why we were inflicting so much carnage and eventually created mass
                        dissension at home. And the angry debate took place in the campuses, in the
                        streets, and in the halls of Congress.</p>
                    <p>Since one of our papers today is on Nicholas Katzenbach, I’d like to quote
                        from Katzenbach’s memoirs <hi rend="italic">Some of It Was Fun</hi> in which
                        he said, “By and large the Congress is not much help to a president in
                        matters of foreign policy because of the lack of political profit in it.”
                        Yet from his own experiences in dealing with Vietnam, it taught Katzenbach
                        that the president alone, “simply cannot hold the overwhelming public
                        support he needs for any length of time without the strong support of
                        Congress.” And I think that’s one of those personal experiences that should
                        inform all policymakers as to what the consequences can be.</p>
                    <p>
                        <lb/> We have a very strong panel here today. Our first speaker is Frank
                        Cain who is a visiting fellow from the School of Humanities and Social
                        Sciences at the University of New South Wales in Canberra. His research
                        interests are the history of the Cold War, intelligence history, and labor
                        history. He is the author of <hi rend="italic">Economic Statecraft During
                            the Cold War</hi> and also <hi rend="italic">Terrorism and Intelligence
                            in Australia: A History of ASIO and National Surveillance</hi>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. CAIN:</hi> Well, thank you. Thank you for that
                        introduction and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for staying back at this
                        late time on the darkening night to listen to the wise words of our panel
                        tonight. Thank you again. Thank you also, John, and the Office of the
                        Historian for running this conference.</p>
                    <p>I’d also like to give a special thanks for – I don’t know whether you’re the
                        object or the direct object for this – but to thank you for the large
                        deposits of State Department papers that are lodged with the National
                        Archives. I’ve used them a lot over the years and my last book on the
                        economic statecraft was written entirely on that collection of the State
                        Department. And even though it’s an economic history to a great extent, the
                        State Department papers include a lot of material from the Defense section,
                        from Commerce, and so on. So there is a marvelous collection and I can only
                        congratulate you on them and also urge you to release more and more of it,
                        more and more of it. We want – we authors would like to see more and more of
                        these papers and also to have them cleared, ready for use.</p>
                    <p>Right, so with that little thank you to you, let’s move on now to discuss the
                        – how America got involved in the war. Now, with all history it’s a matter
                        of selection. It’s a matter of sorting through what is available and putting
                        some emphasis here or there on the arguments put forward. And these are my
                        arguments. They probably will – some of you might find them rather extreme
                        or perhaps unqualified, but, nevertheless, I put them forward and maybe we
                        can – we may have some time at the end to discuss them if you think they’re
                        too overly simplistic.</p>
                    <p>Right, well, let’s – the war really starts with the French returning to
                        Indochina to restore French control over the – Indochina, and they do this
                        because they have been defeated very badly in the war and they’ve been split
                        into two groupings, the sort of the pro-fascist group and the pre-French
                        group. And they have to try and restore some sort of status to themselves as
                        a large power and they, unfortunately, don’t do what the Dutch did, for
                        instance, with Indonesia.</p>
                    <p>Whereas the Dutch thought about returning and then realized it was absolutely
                        impossible and, therefore, gave independence to the Indonesians, the French
                        just kept battling and battling. They really wanted to insist that they come
                        back. And they brought back an army with them – 70,000 men in the French
                        Expeditionary Corps so they could reestablish themselves on the points of
                        the bayonets, because they were so desperate to do this. And it’s rather
                        unfortunate that they did this. Ambassador Negroponte was saying that – the
                        what-ifs of history. And wouldn’t it be marvelous in – among the what-ifs if
                        the French had decided not to stay there like the Dutch did. That is to
                        leave and allow Indochina nationalism to emerge.</p>
                    <p>And this would have been a marvelous thing to have come out so the three
                        million Vietnamese who died would still be with us and the 60,000 U.S. dead
                        would be still with us and the 500 Australian dead would still be with us.
                        So this is one of the interesting turning points of history and it’s a theme
                        that I’m trying to develop with my book on this topic and I hope I can bring
                        out tonight as well.</p>
                    <p>Well, another theme to be included in this is that of China, the giant China.
                        And what happened, of course, in China is that the United States supported
                        the Chinese Government, the Kuomintang Government under Chiang Kai-shek and
                        then continued to support after the war. It had been an ally against the
                        Japanese and so it was understandable the U.S. continue to support it. But
                        unfortunately, Chiang was very weak; his government was very weak, and it
                        was corrupt, and he was really more interested in harboring his resources so
                        he could fight the communists under Mao Zedong who had gone on the Long
                        March to the north to Hunan, and he looked forward to that civil war that
                        was going to emerge.</p>
                    <p>So unfortunately, he wasn’t very interested in fighting the Japanese. He was
                        more interested, as I say, in harboring his resources for this. And then
                        there was internal division within the Kuomintang itself and this, of
                        course, was quite abhorrent to the American officials who were there.
                        General Stilwell sent back constant reports about the incompetence of
                        Chiang. But nevertheless, the Americans were sort of in there for the long
                        term. And eventually, of course, the communist forces moved south and Chiang
                        actually resigned on January, 1949, abandoned his generalissimo status, and
                        moved to Formosa to establish the – sort of the government – the Chinese
                        Government with the intention of resuming and reinvading or invading the
                        mainland.</p>
                    <p>So the whole disappearance of the Kuomintang is sort of – ended in a murmur
                        rather than a bang. And that meant that the PRC was able to get established.
                        The forces that were supporting Chiang switched to support the Mao Zedong
                        forces and so this led to the establishment of the People’s Republic of
                        China in October, 1949. So that’s an important theme and I’m trying to
                        understand what is happening in Indochina, because the PRC, of course, was
                        the means by which the DRV is going to be able to establish the military
                        force to be able to conduct their war and to drive southwards.</p>
                    <p>So – and the establishment of the DRV is very important, of course. It was
                        established in that period between the surrender of the Japanese and the
                        return of the French. So this was led, of course, by Ho Chi Minh, the famous
                        nationalist and it was set up as a functioning organization. And for a while
                        the French even, for a short term, accepted it as being a – as a reasonable
                        alternative government.</p>
                    <p>So that didn’t last very long and the French were prepared to fight to be
                        able to get back in again and the French navy shelled Haiphong and killed
                        6,000 local people in this, and then this led later to the flight of the
                        government. The DRV Government could see that they didn’t have the resources
                        to fight the French at this stage, so they fled. They just left Hanoi and
                        fled into the mountains. The VietBacInter-zone base in the northern
                        mountains of North Vietnam and they functioned as a – not so much a
                        government in exile, but as sort of a continuing government which sounds
                        quite remarkable because they continued to act as an important force until
                        the French themselves withdrew. So this running the DRV out of the cave
                        system in Northern Vietnam is a remarkable sort of effort.</p>
                    <p>Then the French appointed Bao Dai as the leader of the Nationalist French –
                        of the Nationalist Indochina and Bao Dai was a descendent of the Imperial
                        Family. And he had been a puppet – he had led the puppet government during
                        the Japanese occupation. And he’s really assuming another role now as
                        another puppet governor of Indochina. And he – it was really never accepted
                        by the French. They never set him up in Saigon in the, sort of, the
                        Governor’s Palace. He was – he had to stay in Da Lat, a city to the north of
                        Saigon. So he was sort of – as I say, sort of a puppet or an unofficial
                        governor of these territories.</p>
                    <p>
                        <lb/> So – but nevertheless, he had the legitimacy in the eyes of the – many
                        other countries of the world and his government was recognized mainly by
                        western countries and the DRV continued to be represented – still would be
                        recognized by the communist countries. So this brought, of course, Indochina
                        into the Cold War situation.</p>
                    <p>Well, Truman extended aid to what he termed as the General Area of China in
                        July, 1949. And that’s rather interesting, of course, because it’s not until
                        October 1949 that the PRC is established, but Truman sees that, of course,
                        that the PRC is well on their way and that’s why he votes this money to the
                        General Area of China. Well, what is meant by the General Area of China?
                        Well, what he actually meant was all the regions around China, Southeast
                        Asia, and so on, and the Chiefs of Staff, they come up with a conclusion of,
                        sort of, the allocation of this money, and they allocate 15 million of that
                        to Indochina. So the American aid starts really flowing from about July
                        1949.</p>
                    <p>And not only that, but also the Americans move in with other social and
                        economic systems. The Economic Cooperation Administration, the ECA is
                        established that gives aid to the rebuilding to the roads and bridges and
                        that sort of thing. The Americans also set up a thing known as STM; that’s
                        the Special Technical Mission and that gives financial aid for
                        cooperatives.</p>
                    <p>In addition to that, an organization known as MAAG, M double-A G, which
                        stands for the Military Assistance and Advisory Group, is established to
                        oversee the distribution of military aid to the Indochina territories. So
                        you have that, sort of that administrative system being established as well.
                        And I think that’s very important to understanding why America is drawn into
                        this situation in Vietnam, because not only are they giving military aid and
                        they’re funding the military assistance, but of course they’re setting up
                        these administrative systems as well. So that’s another reason why they’re,
                        of course, induced to stay on there.</p>
                    <p>Well, on the other hand, of course, the PRC then sends aid into the Vietminh
                        and the Vietminh troops are sent across the border into China just with
                        sandals and clothing because they’re going to be trained there, they’re
                        going to be given new uniforms, they’re going to be armed and equipped, and
                        they’re going to be trucked back down to – back into North Vietnam again. So
                        this is a very important development and, of course, the Americans see this
                        as well, that they – that the change in China is going to be a big
                        generating force for change in Vietnam as well.</p>
                    <p>Well, Bao Dai is the Nationalist in charge. He has tremendous financial
                        problems. He has these huge deficits, which curiously the French fund for
                        him. And the – and then also there’s a big military development here, a big
                        military buildup. The Vietminh establish an army of 100,000 for guerilla
                        fighting. Bao Dai – there’s a 70 – has the 70,000 French Expeditionary
                        Corps, but also his own sort of Indochinese forces. That’s a 150,000 army
                        that he’s got.</p>
                    <p>So the argument then, of course, comes up with – and this is another
                        important element, I think, is the development within America itself of the
                        motto of who lost China – who lost China for us. And this, for course is a –
                        there’s a plea that is expressed mainly by the Republican forces because
                        they wish to embarrass the Democrats who, of course, the Truman
                        Administration was there when the Communists took over power in China. So
                        that becomes an important theme, I think, because later on, even the
                        Republicans are going to be aware that they could possibly lose Vietnam. So
                        this question of blame and loss becomes an important psychological factor, I
                        think, in America. And that’s another theme, I think, we should always
                        consider in trying to explain why the Americans got involved in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>
                        <lb/> Well, as we know, the United States pressed the French to divest power
                        to the Vietnamese. They can see that the way the French were going was quite
                        impossible. They couldn’t continue to run it just as an autocracy. They had
                        to incorporate the nationalist spirit. They had to have some sort of – it
                        may be an electoral system or something like that. But Bao Dai was resistant
                        to that. But nevertheless, the Americans did continue to pour in arms and
                        equipment. Eisenhower gave a large amount of money and equipment because he
                        wanted to persuade the French that they should be more accommodating to
                        changes in Europe; that is that they should be more accommodating to Germany
                        merging into the European society. So it was sort of a doubled reward for
                        the French in – that is aid for Indochina and also aid in Europe.</p>
                    <p>This, of course, brings in the very important person John Foster Dulles who’s
                        the Secretary of State and he sets up an organization known as SEATO, the
                        Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and I think that’s a very important
                        organization that’s disappeared now off the map. But it was his intention of
                        bringing all together the countries that have any involvement in Southeast
                        Asia; that is Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand,
                        Philippines, and that’s it. So he was trying to bring an organization that
                        would hold the expansion of China and also try and preserve the – or stop
                        the Communists coming to power in Indochina as well.</p>
                    <p>And that’s, as I say, a very important development and it does have some
                        important effect, because that’s really the reason why Australia gets
                        involved in the Vietnam War. It’s this appeal to SEATO and also the more
                        flags that we heard about in other discussions today.</p>
                    <p>
                        <lb/> So this leads us on then to the Geneva Conference. The French now are
                        becoming exhausted. They – there is resentment at home at the huge
                        investment in – thank you – in Indochina and they are really prepared to go,
                        but it’s a matter of finding a means to go. And so there’s a discussion
                        about four-power conferences and five-power conferences. And the conference
                        in Geneva, therefore, turns into a means of settling not only the Korean
                        War, but also set things with the Vietnam War. And the outcome, of course,
                        is – the big outcome is that the Mendes-France government is elected in
                        Paris and Mendes-France is a man who’s been – a leader who is constantly
                        arguing that France should withdraw from Indochina. He’s now the prime
                        minister and he’s able to start suing for peace and thinking about some sort
                        of political settlement in Indochina.</p>
                    <p>So that’s the – that starts to be the withdrawal of France and is hastened,
                        of course, by the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, which you’re all very familiar
                        with this strange battle conducted in a very remote area on the
                        Laotian-Vietnamese border. And we still don’t know why it was fought, but at
                        any rate it was, and lost by the French and that really hastens their
                        disappearance.</p>
                    <p>So now what happens is of course is that Vietnam is going to now slide into
                        the much larger war that we’ve been talking about so much in the last two
                        days. As we know, the Kennedy Administration takes over. He has this bright
                        idea about sending in advisors to help the Vietnamese fight off the
                        Communists. That doesn’t work. He’s replaced by Johnson, and Johnson, of
                        course, is going to be the man who doesn’t lose Vietnam. So this concept of
                        loss and blame reemerges again.</p>
                    <p>So these are the sort of various themes of – I’ve skipped over a number of
                        them. And as I’ve said, you probably will – some people will probably argue
                        with my selection. So I think I’ll leave it there and maybe we can take up
                        further in later discussion. (Applause.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. RITCHIE:</hi> Thank you. Because of time constraints,
                        I think I’m going to make a switch in the order at this stage in the game
                        since Stephen Griffin has a plane that he’s got to catch at the end of this
                        conference. So I’m going to go next to Stephen Griffin who is a professor of
                        constitutional law at Tulane University Law School in New Orleans. He holds
                        law degrees from the University of Kansas and New York University. He’s also
                        taught at the University of Chicago. His books include <hi rend="italic"
                            >American Constitutionalism: From Theory to Politics</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italic">A Reader of Constitutional Theory</hi>. I wish he would be
                        able to explain to us today why so many candidates in this election are
                        running as constitutional defenders, and they’re all proposing
                        constitutional amendments as part of their campaigns.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. GRIFFIN:</hi> Thanks very much. I appreciate the
                        substitution and I believe I’m the only legal academic here. So I wanted to
                        extend a special thank you to the Office of the Historian for whatever black
                        magic was done to get me on the program with such distinguished historians.
                        It’s – really, the level of discussion in this conference has been awe
                        inspiring for someone who largely has to follow the Vietnam debates through
                        the secondary literature.</p>
                    <p>My paper uses Under Secretary of State Nicholas Katzenbach’s 1967 testimony
                        in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as a point of departure
                        to understand past and present arguments on war powers. That testimony
                        brought to a head constitutional issues that had been simmering throughout
                        the war. Katzenbach particularly upset the committed by contending that the
                        Tonkin Gulf Resolution was the quote “functional equivalent” of a
                        declaration of war.</p>
                    <p>Senators understood him to mean that Congress had no effective role in the
                        decision of whether the nation went to war and took great offense. But
                        Katzenbach was no ordinary witness. He had been Attorney General before
                        moving to State having served in the Department of Justice throughout the
                        Kennedy Administration as head of the elite Office of Legal Council and then
                        as Deputy Attorney General. He was familiar with constitutional and
                        international law and had formally advised President Johnson as Attorney
                        General on the legality of the war as Johnson made crucial decisions in
                        1965, two years earlier.</p>
                    <p>Looking past the immediate controversy caused by his testimony, Katzenbach’s
                        statement was one of the most detailed public presentations of the official
                        position of the executive branch on war powers during the Cold War era. As
                        one might expect, it was consistent with the advice President Johnson had
                        been given behind closed doors. On closer inspection, it showed the
                        consistency of the executive branch’s position throughout the Cold War. In
                        broad terms, this position had three elements. First, war powers were shared
                        between the executive and legislative branches, with their meaning being
                        determined largely by historical practice. Second, whatever the meaning of
                        Congress’s power to “declare war” under Article I section 8 of the
                        Constitution, it was not a check on presidential war powers. Third,
                        declarations of war had been rendered obsolete in the new international
                        legal order given life in the UN Charter.</p>
                    <p/>
                    <p>So then I summarize in my paper Katzenbach’s testimony and also the advice
                        given by the legal advisor at the State Department at the time.</p>
                    <p>His testimony was very much a sophisticated international lawyer’s view of
                        postwar history. In this telling, prior to the adoption of the UN Charter,
                        declarations of war were used to announce military adventures of aggression
                        and conquest. This was presumably the meaning such acts had when the
                        Constitution was adopted, Katzenbach implied. But with the acceptance of the
                        Charter came the abolition of war as a matter of international law and the
                        obsolescence of declarations of war. Katzenbach implied strongly that the
                        “declare war” clause was therefore outdated. When asked about the Vietnam
                        War and the role of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, he made the instantly
                        controversial remark that the Resolution was the “functional equivalent of
                        the constitutional obligation expressed in the provision of the Constitution
                        with respect to declaring war;” a kind of wordy way of saying it was the
                        functional equivalent.</p>
                    <p>Katzenbach did not state that the president’s authority to wage the war was
                        essentially based on or limited to the resolution. President Johnson made
                        this clear in a statement while the hearings were occurring, a reiteration
                        of a position he had first taken publicly two years earlier in 1965. Even
                        without the resolution, according to this position of the executive branch
                        was that the president had sole authority to intervene in Vietnam on
                        whatever terms he saw fit.</p>
                    <p>Before moving backwards from these mid-1960s arguments to the 1950 Korea
                        decision which is implicated for reasons I’ll discuss, I want to make three
                        brief points about not only Katzenbach’s testimony but the legal advisor’s
                        advice unto which unfortunately I can’t summarize.</p>
                    <p>
                        <lb/> First, they didn’t provide much in the way of legal authority for
                        their positions. Their statements were more in the nature of position
                        taking. This is not to say they were wrong, but it does highlight how their
                        arguments were dependent on a historical consensus about the meaning of
                        events, such as the Korean intervention, rather than on how those events
                        figured in some valid form of legal argument.</p>
                    <p>Second, the framework in which Katzenbach and the legal advisor approached
                        the question of the legality of the war was, to a substantial degree, shared
                        by members of Congress. That is, members of Congress accepted that the
                        president should take the lead in matters of foreign affairs, even when such
                        matters involved committing troops to combat.</p>
                    <p>Third, legal scholars have not paid sufficient attention to how these
                        statements were broadly consistent with the position taken by the executive
                        branch throughout the Cold War. While Johnson probably believed that
                        President Truman had made a mistake in not asking for a resolution to
                        justify the Korean intervention, this did not mean he believed that such
                        resolutions were legally or constitutionally required. This stance has
                        confused senators and scholars then and now. But it is reasonably supported
                        by the historical record. The perspective Katzenbach provided in his 1967
                        testimony had deep roots at the State Department.</p>
                    <p>In fact, I think the modern version of a broad view of presidential war
                        powers started when Secretary of State Acheson had a memorandum published
                        supporting the constitutionality of Truman’s decision to intervene in Korea
                        with military force. Its thrust was that prior instances of presidents
                        ordering the military to use force to protect specific American lives and
                        property and in the broad interest of American foreign policy provided
                        support for the Korea decision. These instances were framed within the
                        adoption of the UN Charter, which the memo described as a landmark in the
                        development of American foreign policy and the creation of a new
                        international legal order.</p>
                    <p>The memorandum pursued the argument that Truman’s action was justified under
                        the charter in order to ensure the continued existence of the United
                        Nations. This was followed by a list, a very famous list of 85 occasions in
                        which the President had used U.S. armed forces without authorization from
                        Congress for purposes related to foreign affairs and the protection of
                        American citizens. Contemporary versions of this list are now up to over 200
                        instances.</p>
                    <p>From a lawyer’s point of view, the memorandum was curious in several
                        respects. It defined the issue in an odd way, invoking the Commander in
                        Chief clause as the constitutional authority for Truman’s action, but in the
                        context of sending armed forces abroad rather than deciding to go to war
                        with a foreign power. It makes a difference.</p>
                    <p>The textural basis for congressional authority in this area were not
                        discussed, nor was there any discussion of the history of the adoption of
                        the Constitution, views of important members of the founding generation,
                        practice in the early Republic, or a thorough review of judicial
                        precedent.</p>
                    <p>In developing a postwar view concerning presidential war powers, the State
                        Department might have taken inspiration from arguments made during World War
                        II concerning the establishment of a new system of collective security. And
                        in the paper, I discussed an example, a pamphlet – a substantial pamphlet
                        published by James Grafton Rogers in 1945, someone who had served in the
                        State Department in the Hoover Administration, arguing that the U.S.
                        essentially could participate in a system of collective security in a system
                        where the consent of Congress would not be required for every use of the new
                        military force.</p>
                    <p>So the main lines of the State Department’s case for a broad view of
                        executive war power were these. War powers are shared between the executive
                        and legislative branches with a significant sphere of independent authority
                        reserved to the President. The Congressional power to declare war is not a
                        source of exclusive authority over the use of the armed forces, and comes
                        into play only on rare occasions and never in the postwar period. The
                        international legal order given birth by the UN Charter constitutes another
                        source of authority for the President as well as serving as an explanation
                        for the obsolescence of declarations of war. And indeed, as far as I can
                        tell – and this was pointed out by Administration defenders during the war –
                        no country has declared war since 1945, not just us. All of these lines of
                        argument came together in Katzenbach’s 1967 testimony.</p>
                    <p>Now, before I turn to analyzing it from a legal point of view, I want to note
                        some reasons why the debate over the legality of the war was especially
                        tangled and unproductive. These reasons were the product of historical
                        circumstances and had nothing to do, strictly speaking, with the quality of
                        the legal reasoning, but they did affect the debate.</p>
                    <p>To an extent that is surprising today, neither side in the Vietnam era
                        debates wanted to talk much about the significant role declarations of war
                        had played in the twentieth century in authorizing World Wars I and II. No
                        one wanted to talk about the run-up to World War I or the debates over the
                        League of Nations. No one wanted to discuss the events that led to World War
                        II, possibly because the dominant opinion among political elites was that
                        America had waited far too long to enter the conflict against Nazi Germany.
                        So the role of Congressional declarations of war, their historical meaning
                        for the people who were around at the time in the twentieth century went
                        unexamined.</p>
                    <p>Another problem was that members of Congress critical of the war were never
                        in any mood to admit the possibility that the Tonkin Gulf Resolution was
                        fully effective to authorize the war. This led to a great deal of talk still
                        prominent today among historians about the war being undeclared. But we
                        legal scholars would like to know what you mean when you say that. Are you
                        meaning – do you mean that the war was in some sense in legal doubt?</p>
                    <p>This question is harder to answer, since everyone agreed Congress had taken
                        some legislative steps, including authorization of funding, to approve what
                        was happening in Southeast Asia. At the same time, members of Congress
                        skeptical of the war at the time raised a good issue for the future. If
                        formal declarations of war were outmoded, as the executive branch claimed,
                        how would Congress participate effectively in future decisions to engage in
                        armed conflict?</p>
                    <p>So now I’m going to discuss the legal status of the Vietnam War directly,
                        although, hopefully maintaining a historical perspective. It’s a little
                        difficult because as soon as you take a stance on the legality of the war,
                        in a sense you become part of the history that I’m trying to describe. And
                        there are enough legal commentaries on presidential war powers, and I’m not
                        trying to add to them in a doctrinal sense. I think we can gain some
                        critical distance on the constitutional issues by observing that the state
                        of legal knowledge on presidential war powers itself has a history. Most
                        legal scholars, even those very expert and prominent in the 1960s had not
                        thought much about presidential war powers and understandably floundered
                        somewhat in the subsequent debate.</p>
                    <p>The lack of case law was a serious problem. American constitutional law is
                        firmly based on the common law tradition. To oversimplify a bit, this means
                        there is no law without precedents and there are very few meaningful
                        precedents in the area of war powers. This gave competent lawyers very
                        little to work with. After a time, legal scholars realized that declaring
                        war could be accomplished by any means of enactment open to Congress. Any
                        number of authorities could be cited for this proposition, but given that
                        Katzenbach’s testimony looked to considerations of both constitutional and
                        international law, I suggest Louis Henkin’s respected treatise on the law of
                        foreign affairs is a good place to start.</p>
                    <p>Like most legal scholars, Henkin believed it was indisputable that President
                        Johnson had the necessary constitutional authority to wage war in Vietnam
                        from the resolution as well as later appropriations and enactments. He also
                        acknowledged that the UN Charter was designed to outlaw war and to
                        transform, if not eliminate the traditional law of war. However, Henkin
                        contended, as many scholars have, that the UN Charter cannot affect our
                        domestic law that is war powers under the Constitution; it’s not a
                        constitutional amendment.</p>
                    <p>Finally, while Henkin noted that some critics of the war had expressed the
                        view that Congress can decide for war only by formal declaration, he thought
                        that was clearly wrong as Congress could employ a variety of means. Henkin’s
                        treatment of these issues, although fairly standard among legal scholars,
                        differs from many historical accounts. It seems to me that the controversy
                        over Katzenbach’s testimony and the much broader dispute over the resolution
                        had the effect of misleading historians about the legal status of the
                        war.</p>
                    <p>Contrary to what historians may believe, the resolution was fully affected to
                        justify the war in a constitutional sense. So Vietnam was not an undeclared
                        war if by that you mean it was not constitutionally authorized. The
                        appropriate focus from a constitutional point of view, although I admit this
                        would require a lot of further argument, is whether the Constitution –
                        whether a war is authorized, not whether there is a literal document with
                        “declaration of war” written across the top.</p>
                    <p>This can change your view of history because this means that the list of
                        authorized wars is longer than the typical list of declared wars, the
                        so-called five declared wars. The list of authorized wars includes the
                        quasi-war with France, the naval encounters with the Barbary states,
                        Vietnam, the 1991 Gulf War, and the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
                        This shows, if anything, a continuous practice of such authorization, a
                        tradition which tends to make lawyers feel good, a tradition that connects
                        the eighteenth century to our own.</p>
                    <p>
                        <lb/> The most recent scholarship on war powers continues to emphasize that
                        what is important is for Congress to authorize wars whether by declarations
                        or other legislative means. Most constitutional scholars agree that the
                        recent authorizations to use military force, the AUMFs employed both for the
                        wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are the legal and constitutional equivalents of
                        declarations of war. The most extensive reexamination of the Gulf of Tonkin
                        resolution conducted by John Hart Ely, one of the most influential
                        constitutional law scholars of the last half of the twentieth century,
                        reached the same conclusion.</p>
                    <p>While this certainly does not address all of the political issues surrounding
                        how the Johnson Administration obtained congressional assent in 1964, it
                        does point out the continuing relevance both on a legal and policy level of
                        the resolution. In his recently published memoir, Katzenbach addressed the
                        controversy caused by his 1967 testimony. He remarked that, “My position has
                        been vindicated by all subsequent scholars, but infuriated many members of
                        the committee.”</p>
                    <p>Well, Katzenbach is correct to say that it is now accepted that congressional
                        authorizations to engage in armed conflict are the constitutional
                        equivalents of declarations of war. Many commentators would also support
                        Katzenbach’s claim that the UN Charter altered the international law of
                        war.</p>
                    <p>What of the <hi rend="italic">sturm and drang</hi> over the circumstances in
                        which the Resolution was passed? While some senators like Fulbright spent
                        years complaining about how the Johnson Administration got the resolution
                        through Congress, I think we should take note of Henkin’s perceptive
                        observation that the critics of the war were best understood as filing a
                        complaint against what the Constitution allowed, rather than identifying a
                        usurpation of its commands – something still worth thinking about.</p>
                    <p>While there’s a large measure of agreement today among legal scholars with
                        Katzenbach on the points I just mentioned, time has not stilled the
                        controversy over the broader position the executive branch took during the
                        Vietnam War and the Cold War. The Johnson Administration did not argue
                        merely that the resolution provided the authority that was required. It also
                        made the point repeatedly that the resolution was not required. That is, it
                        was not legally obligatory. Here there is strong and continuing disagreement
                        with many of the scholars I have cited just recently agreeing that the
                        resolution was constitutionally required before the President sent troops to
                        fight the war abroad.</p>
                    <p>The war powers debate has suffered from a general lack of historical
                        perspective, I think. I don’t think legal scholars have spent much
                        attention, paid much attention to this consistent position of the branch,
                        the executive branch. It became clear, for example, during the 1991 Gulf War
                        that President George H.W. Bush took this position. At the time, scholars
                        were somewhat incredulous and did not believe Bush’s view has any historical
                        antecedents. But Bush was serious in contending that he had sole authority
                        to send American troops into combat. Members of his national security team
                        believed, like their predecessors, that war was one instrument among others
                        in the making of foreign policy, and that the President had to control
                        it.</p>
                    <p>
                        <lb/> Now, since I’m running out of time, I do want to notice – and don’t
                        want to overpraise Katzenbach – I want to notice two pretty serious problems
                        with his testimony, what he had to say, real quickly.</p>
                    <p>First, Katzenbach took for granted the validity of the Korea precedent. He
                        thought that no one could argue that Truman’s action was unconstitutional.
                        But the weight of scholarly commentary today is not only critical of Truman,
                        but identifies his 1950 decision as the moment when presidential war powers
                        ran off the rails.</p>
                    <p>Further Katzenbach’s interpretation of the war clause created a problem. He
                        made a point of stating to Johnson that a declaration of war would be needed
                        only in the case of a quote “all out war.” I quote that because that
                        position has been taken most recently by a scholar you might have heard
                        about, John Yoo. Now, this successfully identified a role for Congress, but
                        at the cost of rendering Katzenbach’s interpretation of the clause – declare
                        war clause completely ad hoc. But prior to the Cold War, there was no
                        supporting authority for this argument, nor did he cite any.</p>
                    <p>The other problem with his testimony was that he relied on historical
                        practice, this list of the past wars. And I don’t have time, unfortunately,
                        to go into all the problems caused by this list. This list is more of a
                        black box denuded of historical context than a living tradition. And rather
                        than wrap it up with some more on Katzenbach, I want to be respectful of my
                        times and I have time pressures myself. And I’m happy to send the full paper
                        to anyone who’s interested. Thanks very much. (Applause.)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. RITCHIE:</hi> Thank you for those, I think, very
                        significant remarks. I’m going to use my abilities as chair at this point to
                        interrupt our program to bring us a word from our sponsor, and that is
                        really our host for this meeting. Ambassador Brynn, we appreciate everything
                        that you’ve done for us for this meeting, and we give you a few seconds at
                        this – on the podium.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">AMBASSADOR BRYNN:</hi> Thank you, Don. I appreciate
                        everything you’ve done for us and I’m going to have to run, but I did want
                        to take this moment and will be no more than five minutes to say, first of
                        all, thank you to Department of State, to Assistant Secretary Crowley, and
                        to the Bureau of Public Affairs for their work in making this possible. Most
                        importantly, a thanks to Dr. John Carland who I think we should give a round
                        of applause to -- (applause) – and to Margaret Morissey who has been the
                        silent operator to make this whole thing. (Applause.) Margaret, your halo is
                        in the mail. (Laughter.) And to the committee that worked with John in HO, a
                        core group of fantastic people who really have helped to put this together
                        with the very forthcoming assistance of everybody else in HO. This has
                        really been a team effort. Ironically, I have probably done the least for
                        this, but here I am up here to celebrate all the work that HO has done. Just
                        a few comments. I thought it was profoundly significant that we had the
                        presence here of a delegation from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam both
                        representing the country in a diplomatic sense and in a scholarly sense.
                        This is certainly an epical event and says volumes about the new
                        relationship between Vietnam and the United States. Secondly, on a more
                        poignant note, this may be one of the last major conferences where we are
                        going to have the advantage of actual players in the formative years of the
                        conflict in Vietnam. The verdict is out on where they stood and where we
                        think they should have stood on this thing. But seeing the – some of the
                        heavies, in a figurative sense, here I think really is a remarkable tribute
                        to Dr. Carland and to everybody who helped make this conference possible.
                        Third, we certainly have not come to closure on Vietnam. And therefore, I
                        hope that, John, you’ll be preparing another conference here down the road.
                        We’ll give you a couple weeks off. Fourth, we have access now to a whole
                        rich range of new resources because, partly, things are coming up in other
                        archives. But the <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> series of the United States
                        which is now coming out in a number of volumes dealing with Vietnam is a
                        major addition to the corpus of knowledge that will be used by all you
                        scholars to inform us in the future. And I’d like to specifically celebrate
                        the work of HO in – the Historical Office in the production of the <hi
                            rend="italic">FRUS</hi> series regarding Vietnam. This is a watershed
                        era, and I think having the conference to coincide with this watershed is
                        very important. I am going to thank all of you scholars, students,
                        panelists, presenters who have brought to this conference an extraordinarily
                        high quality of presentation. And I will close with one little poignant
                        personal remark. I was assigned to Tan Son Nhut – I was posted to go to Tan
                        Son Nhut Air Force Base in 1969 as a very young air force – very junior air
                        force officer, probably young as well. And I took advantage of the fact that
                        I spoke rather executable French to spend many evenings or some evenings at
                        a local bar to reinforce my French, of course, and drink some <hi
                            rend="italic">Trente-Trois</hi>
                        <hi rend="italic">bier</hi> and I met a guy who was the owner of this little
                        place and he served up some food as well. Of course, then that was in 1969,
                        never thought much more about him until exactly 10 years later in June of
                        1979 when I was driving up from Abidjan and I reached Northern Cote D’Ivoire
                        and stopped in Ferkessedougou to find a little place. So then I – who in
                        God’s name was the owner of the <hi rend="italic">auberge</hi> but this guy.
                        (Laughter.) We sat there and drank more beer that evening and he said to me,
                        “Mr. Brynn, someday somebody’s going to publish a volume which will explain
                        the war in Vietnam.” Thank you. (Applause)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. RITCHIE:</hi> Thank you very much. We’ve been talking
                        about the international nature of this conference, and our next speaker is a
                        truly international person. Fabian Hilfrich is a lecturer in American
                        history at the University of Edinburgh. He did his undergraduate studies in
                        Munich. He got his master’s degree at Washington University in St. Louis and
                        a Ph.D. from the Free University of Berlin. His interests are in nationalism
                        and imperialism, and his writing has been on Vietnam and the Philippines.
                        And so that sums up quite an international package, I think, for our next
                        speaker.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. HILFRICH:</hi> Thank you for the kind introduction,
                        and I also don’t want to miss joining everyone in thanking you for this
                        fantastic conference and the great organization. I wish the – the only
                        complaint that I might have is that I was actually coming here from Scotland
                        hoping for a little better weather, but – (laughter) – I guess at least I
                        can say that your rain is a lot warmer than ours. (Laughter.) Now, let me
                        take my allotted time to talk a little bit about the Vietnam War debate, and
                        specifically about the role of patriotism and dissent in the Vietnam War
                        debate. Now, in democratic societies, dissent can be a problem – dissent in
                        wartime. On the one hand, freedom of speech is, of course, a fundamental
                        democratic right that cannot be suspended at will. On the other hand,
                        widespread dissent can undermine the appearance of a united home front,
                        which can be a crucial quasi-military asset, as was particularly true in the
                        limited war setting of the Vietnam War, where victory consisted of
                        convincing the enemy to stand down, not of defeating him completely.
                        Policymakers, therefore, considered it indispensable that the enemy believe
                        that the United States was committed to the war effort.</p>
                    <p>Now, this dilemma between democracy and wartime needs circumscribed the
                        rationale, but also some of the limitations of government efforts to tackle
                        domestic dissent. My paper today analyzes the rhetorical strategies the
                        Johnson and Nixon Administrations used to de-legitimize dissent without
                        banning it, as well as the responses of the critics to such efforts. This
                        sort of sub-debate of the Vietnam War debate on the legitimacy of dissent in
                        wartime culminated in rivaling definitions of patriotism, which actually
                        perfectly fit Alexis de Tocqueville’s distinction between instinctive and
                        reflective types of patriotism. Whereas the former, the instinctive
                        patriotism, demands collective and automatic loyalty to the nation as such,
                        the latter focuses the individual’s loyalties on the nation’s democratic
                        ideals.</p>
                    <p>From this finding, we can draw several important conclusions about the
                        Vietnam War debate. The fact that most critics do not cede the patriotic
                        label to the interventionists demonstrates that the Vietnam War did not
                        destroy a fundamental consensus on American exceptionalism. At the same
                        time, however, the disagreement about the meaning of patriotism points to a
                        deeper disagreement about the essence of the American national character.
                        The interventionists’ instinctive patriotism was a symptom of an otherwise
                        increasingly nationalist and chauvinist rhetoric which focused on military
                        prowess and dramatized the threat of Vietnam to the very survival of the
                        United States as a nation – in other words, a nationalism that invoked the
                        nation as such. The dissenters, by contrast, clung to a democratic
                        understanding of their nation’s essence, believing America was threatened
                        more by the administrations’ war policies than by the enemy from
                        without.</p>
                    <p>This debate on dissent and patriotism also lets us observe how certain
                        rhetorical strategies work in wartime generally, and specifically in the
                        context of a limited war. Instinctive patriotic appeals internalized the
                        war, creating the impression that the dissenters, rather than the enemies,
                        were to blame for the stalemate in Vietnam. This dramatic narrative was more
                        effective than that of a democratic crusade on behalf of South Vietnam – of
                        course, the other main justification used by the government. Yet the
                        conception of Vietnam as a limited war with safeguards against potential
                        escalation prevented the government from exploiting this emotional reservoir
                        to its fullest.</p>
                    <p>The right to dissent was, to be sure, rarely questioned on principle,
                        particularly not in the early years of the conflict. Both Presidents Johnson
                        and Nixon affirmed the constitutional right to free speech, often labeling
                        it, and I quote, “the strength of the American system instead of a
                        weakness.” This was not only a necessary affirmation in a democracy, it also
                        enabled the government to make the connection to Vietnam, where they claimed
                        to be fighting for just such rights.</p>
                    <p>Behind closed doors, however, Johnson and Nixon felt quite differently. They
                        refused to believe their own intelligence services, which found no evidence
                        of communist subversion of the antiwar movement. They toyed with the idea of
                        censorship and they blurred or violated constitutional safeguards in order
                        to control antiwar groups. Rhetorically, which is more important for my
                        purposes, there were subtler ways to de-legitimize protest.</p>
                    <p>As in other conflicts, defenders of the Vietnam War implied quite simply that
                        the critics were cowards. Democratic Senator Thomas Dodd attacked the,
                        quote, “querulous, faint-hearted chorus of those who always ask for the
                        price of victory.” And Secretary of State Dean Rusk referred to the
                        dissenters simply as quitters.</p>
                    <p>In contrast to other wars, this discourse of a deficit in masculinity was
                        frequently sublimated in the language of foreign policy realism, a
                        supposedly dispassionate conception of international relations founded on
                        the national interest. A realist evaluation of the situation, the
                        interventionists claimed, could only lead to the conclusion that the war had
                        to be fought. Consequently, critics were also attacked as naïve and
                        gullible. In a further variation on this theme, interventionists added that
                        only the executive possessed the information necessary for an informed
                        judgment, but that it could not share it for security reasons. The
                        implication, of course, was that the president ought to be trusted with
                        making the right decisions. Now, we’re all also familiar with this executive
                        privilege of knowledge argument from the early days of the Iraq War, when we
                        were similarly asked to trust the government’s information on WMD in
                        Iraq.</p>
                    <p>The most damaging line of attack was the equation of dissent with treason,
                        more specifically that it emboldened the enemy, demoralized and endangered
                        American soldiers abroad. Again in public, the government tread lightly. The
                        closest President Johnson came to charging his opponents with treason was
                        the frequently-repeated concern that dissent might send, quote, “false
                        signals,” both to Hanoi and to the Viet Cong. Partisan politicians and
                        pundits were less circumspect. In the <hi rend="italic">National
                        Review</hi>, for example, James Fletcher flatly assigned moral
                        responsibility for the victims of the Tet Offensive to the dissenters at
                        home, a move which seriously questioned the very legitimacy of antiwar
                        opposition.</p>
                    <p>Behind closed doors, however, Administration officials were as sanguine as
                        Fletcher, considering the home front as, quote, “the weakest chink in the
                        nation’s armor,” and the critics as responsible for the setbacks in Vietnam.
                        When Richard Nixon asked Dean Rusk in 1968 [?] where the war had been lost,
                        Rusk responded laconically, in the editorial rooms of this country.</p>
                    <p>Now, such thinking internalized the conflict. Stamina and willpower on the
                        home front became more important than military victories on the battlefront,
                        and the antiwar movement emerged as the real enemy. There may have been some
                        truth to this interpretation in the context of a limited war, which was
                        predicated on convincing the enemy that the United States would stay the
                        course. Nevertheless, this reading turned into an obsession, one that
                        conveniently shifted the blame for an unsuccessful and ill-conceived war. It
                        also flattered the sensibilities of a nation that found it inconceivable
                        that a small country and a ragtag group of guerrillas could defeat the most
                        powerful country on earth. Nixon formulated this hubris publicly in the
                        “Silent Majority” speech. And I quote, “Let us understand North Vietnam
                        cannot defeat or humiliate the United States. Only Americans can do
                        that.”</p>
                    <p>Now, taken together, these rhetorical strategies undermined the official
                        claim that dissent was being protected and tolerated. At least implicitly,
                        dissenters were branded as traitors and the main obstacle to victory and
                        peace in Vietnam. Roughly speaking, the dissenters had two responses, a
                        moderate and a radical one. Moderate dissenters accepted the terms of the
                        debate and tried to refute their opponents’ arguments, whereas radicals
                        attacked the government’s logic altogether. Moderate critics, on whom I will
                        spend more time, insisted on their constitutional right to free speech,
                        frequently labeling this a particularly American right, thereby already
                        implying that they were loyal patriots. By the same token, suppression of
                        dissent served as a key example of their larger claim that the war abroad
                        was undermining democracy at home.</p>
                    <p>Moderate antiwar critics also tackled the subtler strategies of their
                        opponents. There were enough foreign policy realists among them, most
                        notably Hans Morgenthau, who had coined the term, to credibly contest the
                        notion that the war was the realists’ choice. They maintained that it was
                        not in the national interest. If the government charged them with naiveté,
                        they countered by labeling their opponents crusading idealists. Finally,
                        they attacked this executive privilege of knowledge argument by highlighting
                        that democratic decision-making required wide dissemination of crucial
                        information, and that the government was undermining the democratic process
                        if it monopolized information.</p>
                    <p>The charges of treason were more difficult to refute. Defensively, moderates
                        took pains to appear evenhanded, incorporating criticism of the enemy’s
                        methods, brutality, and reluctance to engage in peace talks, in their
                        material. More offensively, they emphasized that their criticism was not
                        designed to encourage the enemy but to dissuade the United States from
                        pursuing policies they deemed more dangerous than the enemy. Moderate
                        dissenters also went to great lengths to praise the soldiers. George F.
                        Kennan’s testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1966
                        typified this strategy. He opened with praise for, quote, “the finest
                        fighting force ever fielded by the United States,” unquote, but then
                        criticized, quote, “the purpose for which they are being employed.”</p>
                    <p>For critics in Congress, the issue arose most concretely in military
                        appropriations. For most of the war, they stopped short of using the power
                        of the purse to end the conflict because they realized, as Senator Fulbright
                        did, that a negative vote, quote, “would clearly be misinterpreted, and
                        anyone who does that would be branded a traitor, and it is emotionally and
                        politically unacceptable to vote against supplies for the people in the
                        field.” The interventionists’ demand to support the soldiers clearly blunted
                        lawmakers’ potentially most powerful legislative weapon.</p>
                    <p>Now, in addition to serving as a shibboleth against dissent, the American
                        soldier became also the model of interventionist patriotism. Although
                        interventionists did celebrate the soldier’s willingness to die for
                        Vietnamese freedom and democracy, they increasingly emphasized his
                        unconditional loyalty and obedience, without even asking about the purpose
                        for which he was being employed. They praised the soldier’s selfless
                        devotion and demanded, quote, “the same courage, the same stability, and the
                        same good judgment of the home front.” If the soldiers were prepared to
                        bring the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of the collective, even without
                        asking why, was it too much to ask that their compatriots at home support
                        them by backing the war effort?</p>
                    <p>The interventionists supplemented this unquestioning soldierly patriotism
                        with an emphasis on the need for national unity. If President Johnson had
                        earlier celebrated dissent as a strength of the American system, he soon
                        considered it a weakness. In the wake of the Tet Offensive, he warned, “I
                        pray that you and every American will take to heart my plea that we guard
                        against divisiveness. United, we are strong. Divided, we are in great
                        danger.” This plea, frequently repeated by Nixon – thank you – returned to
                        the idea that dissent was to blame for military reverses in Vietnam. The
                        basis for the invoked unity was not considered agreement on the objectives
                        of the war but Tocqueville’s instinctive patriotism, an automatic response
                        triggered by attacks on American soldiers abroad.</p>
                    <p>Now, a representative of moderate antiwar critics, Senate Majority Leader
                        Mike Mansfield, attacked this reading of unity in a memorandum to the
                        President. And he said, “I think that free and constructive discussion
                        remains the key to unity in this nation. Without it, there can only be an
                        illusion of unity which fools no one abroad.” Against the government’s,
                        quote, “blind faith under the name of patriotism,” unquote, the dissenters
                        pitted their understanding of reasoned support, which alone could produce
                        sustainable national unity. This patriotism turned the right to dissent into
                        a duty. Fulbright called it actually a higher form of patriotism because it
                        required more courage. This was de Tocqueville’s reflective patriotism,
                        focused on the nation’s ideals and based on an individual case-by-case
                        decision rather than a collective reflex. According to the critics,
                        America’s ideals were threatened much more by official Vietnam policies than
                        the nation’s physical boundaries were by Hanoi and the Viet Cong.</p>
                    <p>Now, with this response, of course, moderate critics had staked their own
                        claim to American patriotism. By contrast, some radical critics consciously
                        rejected patriotism and looked for new allegiances. They openly sympathized
                        with America’s enemies, advocating their victory as the only possible and
                        actually just end to the war, and as the necessary catalyst for a revolution
                        in the United States. While white radicals fraternized with North Vietnam
                        and the Viet Cong on the basis of ideological convergence, African American
                        radicals emphasized racial kinship and the supposedly shared experience of
                        the oppression of non-white people by white America. They transferred their
                        allegiance from their native country towards an imagined community of
                        non-white peoples and nations. In their effort to topple the system that
                        they blamed for the war, these radicals rejected the government-imposed
                        terms of the debate and deliberately also broke the law, in some instances.
                        Such thinking certainly possessed its own inner logic, but it also allowed
                        the government to mobilize the so-called silent majority against the entire
                        antiwar movement, portraying it as criminal, extreme, and unpatriotic.</p>
                    <p>Still, the radicals’ rejection of patriotism remained a minority response. In
                        fact, that it’s remarkable that most dissenters – most debaters on both
                        sides of the divide emphasized their patriotism, disagreeing only about its
                        meaning. The different conceptions are probably best summarized in two
                        versions of one slogan that clashed long before the 1960s but which were
                        revived during the Vietnam War debate. James Burnham of the <hi
                            rend="italic">National Review</hi> described the interventionist variant
                        as, quote, “the older rule of the loyal citizen. My country, may she ever be
                        right, but my country, right or wrong. Generally speaking, a nation is
                        injured or destroyed by losing a war, even if it’s the wrong war,”
                        unquote.</p>
                    <p>Juxtaposed to this was the dissenters’ version, originally formulated by the
                        German American called Schurz in the 1870s. And I quote, “My country, right
                        or wrong. If right, to be kept right, and if wrong, to be set right.” These
                        slogans represent different readings of American nationalism. The
                        interventionist version referred to the nation, per se, as a given and
                        unchanging collective, to which the patriot owed an automatic and
                        un-reflected allegiance, even if it was engaged in the wrong war. Critics’
                        loyalty, on the other hand, was individualized, considered, and extended to
                        the ideals and democratic principles upon which the country had been
                        founded. For these dissenters, America was an idea rather than a country. A
                        wrong war, even a victorious one, could destroy this idea, and with it the
                        entire nation.</p>
                    <p>In terms of the trajectory of the Vietnam War debate, the interventionists’
                        growing emphasis on instinctive patriotism highlights the limited success of
                        selling the war as an altruistic democratic crusade. This more idealistic
                        and cerebral argument was not only increasingly questioned in the 1960s, it
                        probably never carried the same motivational force as raw patriotism and
                        nationalism. As the war turned into a stalemate, and as the cacophony of
                        critical voices grew louder, interventionist congressmen and pundits called
                        for a more explicit, quote, “act of national consecration because patriotism
                        is the final and the greatest reserve of any nation-state,” unquote.</p>
                    <p>Although Johnson and Nixon increasingly obliged, as we have seen, this change
                        had intrinsic boundaries in the context of a limited war in which emotions
                        are controlled for the purpose of controlling escalation. The result of
                        these countervailing demands, a war in cold blood weighed against the need
                        to mobilize the home front led to contradictory propaganda policies, which
                        Johnson’s speechwriter Harry McPherson, who of course was here yesterday,
                        aptly described as, quote, “something like a semi-satisfactory sexual
                        experience.” (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>The upward trajectory of instinctive patriotic appeals demonstrates that
                        policymakers were well aware of its mobilizing potential and of the limited
                        appeal of idealistic rhetoric. Limited war strategy, however, kept them from
                        exploiting this potential to the fullest.</p>
                    <p>Thank you very much (Applause.)</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">DR. RITCHIE:</hi> Thank you. I’ve been thinking that if,
                        40 years ago, someone had told me I’d be at the State Department 40 years
                        later discussing the history of the Vietnam War, listening to Henry
                        Kissinger speak with a Vietnamese flag behind him as he was speaking, I
                        would have been very surprised. But if they told me the conference was going
                        to end with a paper on dissent, I would have said, well, I can expect that.
                        And I think that was quite an appropriate conclusion.</p>
                    <p>But we do have one more speaker, who is our commentator. And I think it’s
                        especially appropriate that David Anderson get the last word at this
                        conference because he is a professor of history and a former dean at the
                        University – at California StateUniversity at Monterey. But it’s almost
                        impossible to study the Vietnam War without running up against David
                        Anderson’s books. He has a long list of publications on the war, including
                            <hi rend="italic">Shadow on the White House: Presidents and the Vietnam
                            War, The Colombia Guide to the Vietnam War, The War That Never
                            Ends,</hi> and it’s also appropriate that he be our last speaker
                        because, from 1968 to 1970, he served in Vietnam as a sergeant in the Army
                        Signal Corps.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. ANDERSON:</hi> Thank you Don, and thank you, John. I
                        think I can’t say, like Secretary Kissinger, that peace is at hand, but
                        maybe I can say the end of the conference is at hand. (Laughter.)</p>
                    <p>My job here is to take these papers, which I would call a string of pearls,
                        and to make – add the string. So I think I will do that to fit these
                        interesting papers together into some kind of string.</p>
                    <p>In all three of these papers, I suggest that the string is the year 1950,
                        which looms very large in the history of U.S. decisions that led to military
                        intervention in Vietnam. Steve Griffin, who, unfortunately, had to leave but
                        – to catch a plane, has provided a thorough examination of the 1950 thesis
                        on presidential war power. Frank Cain makes the important observation that
                        in February 1950, the Truman Administration recognized the Bao Dai
                        government in Vietnam and began large-scale aid to anticommunist forces
                        there. Fabian Hilfrich, in his excellent analysis of the clash between
                        American proponents of instinctive patriotism and reflective patriotism,
                        doesn’t explicitly single out 1950, but I will make my own connection to
                        that in a moment.</p>
                    <p>Cain appropriately sets the Indochina policy decisions of the Truman and
                        Eisenhower administrations explicitly in the context of the loss of China, a
                        political charge from the China lobby, and the strategic assessment by both
                        the Truman and Eisenhower administrations that the new communist regime in
                        China must be contained. He notes that the United States loaned Chiang
                        Kai-shek’s government $125 million in 1948 but did not send U.S. troops. The
                        voice of constraint, by the way, was Secretary of State George Marshall.
                        Cain notes in a quote he did not share with you in his remarks there that
                        Marshall also warned France in 1947 that the colonial empires of the 19th
                        century were a thing of the past. Marshall was making clear that the United
                        States would not underwrite the military defense of Chiang’s regime and was
                        not supportive of French colonialism.</p>
                    <p>In 1949, as Cain points out, preparing for Chiang’s collapse, the Truman
                        Administration provided $75 million for the general area of China to prevent
                        further encroachment of communism. Fifty million of this sum went to
                        Indochina. In February 1950, the United States did recognize the
                        French-backed Bao Dai regime and began to funnel aid to the French war
                        effort against the communist Viet Minh. Cain reiterates that the U.S.
                        objective in Asia was fear of an expanding China. The first funds in 1949
                        were just the beginning, and importantly, he points out Chinese aid to the
                        Viet Minh beginning in 1950 strengthened U.S. determination to maintain the
                        war against the Chinese communists from Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>When the French left Vietnam after the Geneva conference, he points out,
                        Dulles and Eisenhower reversed Marshall and Truman’s initial caution, and
                        the United States began to underwrite South Vietnam as a counter to
                        communist China.</p>
                    <p>Hilfrich, as you’ve heard, makes effective use of the dichotomy described by
                        Alexis de Tocqueville, between instinctive patriotism and reflective
                        patriotism. To use contemporary terminology, Tocqueville is interpreting
                        patriotism as constructed, as have a long line of historians.
                        Interventionists in Vietnam used the rhetoric of instinctive patriotism to
                        portray dissenters as cowards and traitors. Further, they argued that
                        dissent undermined U.S. credibility with its enemies by raising doubts that
                        America had the wherewithal to stay the course. The interventionists saw the
                        greatest threat to success in Vietnam to be the lack of political will.</p>
                    <p>Hilfrich quotes Nixon’s silent majority speech: “North Vietnam cannot defeat
                        or humiliate the United States. Only Americans can do that.” These words
                        recall for me 1950. On January 25, 1950, a jury convicted Alger Hiss of
                        perjury in the famous case in which Congressman Nixon had taken a leading
                        role in the investigation of Hiss as an alleged spy. On February 9, 1950,
                        Senator Joseph McCarthy made his debut “Communists in the Government” speech
                        at Wheeling, West Virginia. McCarthyism was the product of conservative
                        Republican frustration. These frustrations found a malignant release in
                        McCarthy’s crusade to uncover communists in the government. He offered a
                        simple panacea. If subversives could be exposed and eliminated, then
                        everything would be alright in America and in the world. The United States
                        was right and powerful and could only be defeated by its internal cowardice
                        and treachery. If you believe that only Americans can defeat America, as
                        Congressman Nixon seemed to in 1950 and President Nixon did in 1969, then
                        you have an obligation to say so. There was a lack of understanding here of
                        the power of other nations and the limits of U.S. power, a lack of
                        realism.</p>
                    <p>Griffin notes that moderate dissenters had emphasized the ideals of free
                        speech and democracy, and that other realist dissenters like Hans Morgenthau
                        maintained that the war simply was not in the national interest. In his
                        paper, Cain points – makes the point that the United States chose, for
                        realist reasons, not to fight the Chinese communists through Chiang
                        Kai-shek. And there was a similar logic not to fight China in Vietnam
                        through Bao Dai or Ngo Dinh Diem. Realists viewed the interventionists as
                        idealists who saw no limit to U.S. power and ideals.</p>
                    <p>Hilfrich generalizes dissenters, although he mentions radical and a group – a
                        variety of dissenters, but he generalizes dissenters basically as liberal
                        dissenters. But I would note that the majority school of Vietnam War
                        historiography is a school often termed liberal realist. That may sound
                        paradoxical, but a dual critique of the war appears in most of the
                        literature. The liberal dissenters would have said that the war diverged
                        from American ideals of self-determination and did not recognize the
                        nationalist and social justice goal of Vietnamese revolutionaries. I think
                        that appears in the historiography.</p>
                    <p>The realist dissent has also informed the historiography. It views the United
                        States as a regular nation, not necessarily exceptional, with national
                        interests and specific capabilities that have to be kept in balance with
                        each other and with the interests and power of other nations. As Hilfrich
                        notes, the interventionists’ instinctive patriotic rhetoric had failed.
                        Instinctive patriotism is difficult in limited wars and wars of choice such
                        as Vietnam. They are not wars for national survival. If the reasons for
                        American policy had been instinctive, there would likely have been a
                        declaration of war and a national mobilization.</p>
                    <p>Griffin examines the absence of a declaration of war. In wars of choice,
                        which the U.S. wars since 1945 have been, who chooses, the president or
                        Congress? The wartime debate between interventionists and dissenters came at
                        various times to the charge that the American war in Vietnam was undeclared
                        or presidential, and by implication, thus illegal or unconstitutional. Now,
                        Griffin finds persuasive the claim by Nicholas Katzenbach and others that
                        presidents have the power to authorize warfare, and that the Gulf of Tonkin
                        Resolution clearly was a congressional authorization for the president to
                        use force in Southeast Asia. The question remains open, however, he points
                        out, as to how the executive and legislature share war powers if that is
                        indeed the case. The Tonkin resolution did not declare that a state of war
                        existed, as FDR’s famous “Day of Infamy” speech did in December 1941.</p>
                    <p>Limited wars, like Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, do not by definition
                        mean a national mobilization or that a state of war exists. What is an
                        all-out war, the term employed by Katzenbach? It should be noted, by the
                        way, that Johnson did not want an all-out war that would give conservatives
                        in Congress a reason not to fund his cherished Great Society. As Griffin
                        observes, Katzenbach and others who have advanced the presidential war power
                        thesis have relied more on historical experience than legal precedent. In
                        fact, it’s flattering to us scholars to know that our study has such public
                        policy significance. I often have quite the opposite impression that
                        policymakers know little about what we write from archival sources.</p>
                    <p>AUMFs, authorizations to use military force, in Iraq and Afghanistan are, as
                        we’ve heard, the legal equivalents of the declaration of war. In a
                        post-modern war, that is a war against terrorists, whom does the government
                        declare war against? An AUMF would seem more applicable today than a
                        declaration of war.</p>
                    <p>Even with the advent of the UN and its desire to eliminate war, as we heard,
                        however, the concept of an attack or use of force has meaning as a state of
                        war when the conflict is between two sovereign nations. The UN charter may
                        have altered the international law of war, as Griffin attests, but it did
                        not itself alter the way that nations think of war, that is between nation
                        states. An international legalist could say that the United States
                        officially did not recognize the DRV Government, and that to declare war
                        would have been to recognize it as a belligerent and thus as a state.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, since the United States had agreed not to interfere with
                        force with the implementation of the Geneva Accords of 1954, it had
                        recognized de facto the DRV. Since the DRV was in fact internationally
                        recognized as a nation, Congress legally could have expected and demanded a
                        request for a declaration of war in 1964 or 1965. Beginning with Truman,
                        presidents have consistently argued that congressional authorization was not
                        needed at all. Constitutional historians generally agree that the 1950
                        thesis employed to sanction presidential action in Korea breached
                        constitutional tradition in a fundamental way.</p>
                    <p>During the Vietnam War, members of Congress were slow to respond to the
                        executive. A good example is Congressman Clement Zablocki of Wisconsin. He
                        was – he went from being a Cold War rubber stamp for presidential leadership
                        to a co-sponsor of the War Powers Resolution. He personified the growing
                        public skepticism about executive authority or claims of authority. In
                        Hilfrich’s terms, he went from being an instinctive patriot to being a
                        reflective patriot. Griffin ends, appropriately, noting that the containment
                        strategy requires centralized decision-making to be effective. During the
                        Cold War, Congress often did not struggle with the executive because members
                        of Congress and the executive accepted the containment paradigm. As Louis
                        Fisher, in his book <hi rend="italic">Presidential War Powers,</hi> has
                        argued, and Griffin also argues, Congress was not assertive enough of its
                        constitutional role.</p>
                    <p>One of Griffin’s historical points, which he did not list, the – it was 85
                        points in Katzenbach’s memos – he points out that many of these precedents
                        for unilateral presidential authorization of force were, in many cases,
                        racist, imperialist, gunboat diplomacy in Asia, the Pacific, and Latin
                        America. And these were instances which most modern chiefs of – chief
                        executives would not want to be associated. In other words, Katzenbach’s
                        list actually cited as precedent the record of American imperialism as a
                        justification for U.S. intervention in Vietnam. Wow. Where was George
                        Marshall when we needed him?</p>
                    <p>All three of these excellent papers point to lessons not heeded. In Cain’s
                        paper, we see the departure of U.S. policy in Vietnam, beginning with Dulles
                        and Eisenhower, away from George Marshall’s sound cautions about the United
                        States underwriting a war with the Chinese communists through third parties.
                        In Hilfrich’s paper, we see the contested ground of patriotism, which is
                        still with us. Is it not paradoxical that a central response to instinctive
                        patriotism to the war on terror was a bill actually entitled the Patriot
                        Act, which allowed restrictions on reflective patriotism?</p>
                    <p>Finally, in Griffin’s paper, we see the rationalisms and distorted history
                        that enabled Johnson to conduct a presidential war in Vietnam, and other
                        presidents have also employed. One Vietnam War should’ve been enough for
                        American public discourse on war to learn not to accept uncritically
                        executive assertions to “trust me; I know best,” in defense of
                        interventionist uses of force.</p>
                    <p>Thank you. (Applause.)</p>

                        over time, but it seems only fair, since you have persevered so long, to
                        allow those in the audience to participate in a few questions at the end.
                        And there are several hands up in the front, here.</p>
                    <p>Can you –</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> My question is for Professor Hilfrich. I
                        actually wanted to congratulate you on your very insightful exploration on
                        this dualism of reflective and instinctive patriotism. My question as a
                        post-colonial scholar would be, you’ve obviously, I assume, invoked Benedict
                        Anderson’s idea of imagined communities to this particular situation. Would
                        you care to talk a little bit about, in these (inaudible) narratives of
                        resistance and subversion, on the other hand, and nationalistic impulses on
                        the other, have the paradigms shifted since the Vietnam War, in your opinion
                        as a historian, in cases such as the war we are fighting in Afghanistan or
                        the Iraq War? And if they have, how have the paradigms shifted?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. HILFRICH:</hi> I think perhaps, if anything, the
                        discourse of instinctive patriotism has even, in some respects – and I think
                        – I have one concrete example in mind – has gotten stronger. I mean, first,
                        of course – first of all, I was struck by – that, of course, the normal use
                        of the word patriotism, as we encountered it, for example, in Dr.
                        Kissinger’s remarks, too, was just, I mean, patriotism means instinctive
                        patriotism. Patriotism means supporting one’s country in wartime, no matter
                        whether this is a necessary war or a war of choice. So that is still very
                        much with us that the automatic assumption is patriotism means instinctive
                        patriotism.</p>
                    <p>But where I think the Vietnam War has, in fact, ended up in some respects
                        strengthening the case for instinctive patriotism is through the role of the
                        soldier. I’ve emphasized in my paper how important the soldier is as a model
                        of this kind of patriotism and also as reminding the audience that you have
                        to support the soldier. Now, and particularly because, of course, there is
                        the conventional wisdom of the Vietnam War, that the soldier has been
                        abandoned by particularly the critics but also the public at large. And I
                        think we see a lot of that – there is a lot of preemptive obedience on the
                        part of the American public. And I think what they sometimes don’t see is
                        that not necessarily does support for the soldier mean support for the war.
                        And a critic of the first hour of the Vietnam War, Wayne Morse, for example,
                        said the best way to support the soldier is to bring him home.</p>
                    <p>So there are different views on what support of the soldier means as well,
                        whether it’s – whether the only support is then also supporting the war in
                        which the soldier is currently engaged. So, but I think in that respect,
                        Vietnam has actually strengthened the case for instinctive patriotism.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">DR. RITCHIE:</hi> Question here?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> Yes, I just want to say that one thing I
                        felt that was lacking in the discussion of changes in war-making was the
                        presence of nuclear weapons and the degree to which that changed people’s
                        assessments of the time and what would happen in a war, and gave strength to
                        the executive. The second point about that was, of course, connected to your
                        point about all-out war. One of the fears, of course, of all-out war was
                        that there would be a push toward escalation, and that was the problem for
                        presidents to face, and so that Johnson not only wanted to defended his
                        liberal programs but he also feared the political pressure for escalation
                        that had happened during Korea and that Truman had faced as well, so that
                        that also became a reason for not employing the declaration of war.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. ANDERSON:</hi> If I may, in Steve’s absence, Tom, he
                        does talk in his paper about the Cold War. He goes to some extent about the
                        general – especially in the ’50s, with the advent of the nuclear war and the
                        general consensus that this level of danger requires a kind of ability to
                        strategize and centralize the authority. I think that you could probably
                        argue, and I think he does, that by the time of the ’60s, that’s changing
                        somewhat. But it’s still that legacy of the ’50s and the whole nuclear
                        danger and the prudent – containment being prudent, I think, has a strong
                        impact on this invitation to struggle between communists – I mean the
                        Congress and the president.</p>

                        <hi rend="strong">DR. RITCHIE:</hi> We have a question from the
                        bleachers.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> For Professor Hilfrich, are you aware of
                        any jailed protesters having the writ of habeas corpus suspended in their
                        case, like President Lincoln did, by either Johnson or Nixon?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">PROF. HILRICH:</hi> Not aware of having it personally
                        suspended by the presidents. But of course, there were cases, and there were
                        particularly cases on the state level. And so these cases did come up. But
                        for the most part, when they were followed through – and very often, it was
                        the ACLU who took up those cases – whereas the ACLU tried to painstakingly
                        avoid taking a position on the war, whether it was for or against the war,
                        it did take up these cases, and generally won them as well.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">DR. RITCHIE:</hi> Another question? We have a comment? Do
                        you have a microphone?</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="strong">QUESTION:</hi> This is not so much in the form of a
                        question (inaudible). But Tom very graciously allows me to introduce some
                        additional testimony, if you will. This has been an excellent conference,
                        but I’ve been listening very carefully, and it was only Professor Griffin’s
                        remarks in the – previous to this panel that I heard the words “collective
                        security” mentioned in this conference. And I – that has been the missing
                        framework of this discussion. I am David Rusk. I’m the elder son of Dean
                        Rusk. My younger brother, Rich, you’ve heard from earlier, and I appreciate
                        his assistance in this.</p>
                    <p>I’d like to share some words from Dean Rusk from his memoirs that he
                        collaborated with Rich on, to put a framework on the issue of Vietnam,
                        particularly on the question of collective security – can you hear in the
                        back okay? Okay. Is that all right? Working fine? It is August of 1963 and
                        our dad is in the Crimea meeting with Khrushchev on the occasion of the
                        signing of the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty merely 10 months after the
                        Cuban Missile Crisis. And he writes that, “During our talks at the Black
                        Sea, Khrushchev drew me aside with only his interpreter and told me
                        something that still chills my blood. Mr. Rusk, said Khrushchev, Konrad
                        Adenauer has told me that Germany will not fight a nuclear war over Berlin.
                        Charles de Gaulle has told me that France will not fight a nuclear war over
                        Berlin. Harold McMillan has told me that England will not fight a nuclear
                        war over Berlin. Why should I believe that you Americans would fight a
                        nuclear war over Berlin?” And my dad writes, “I stared back at Khrushchev
                        and said, ‘Mr. Chairman, you will have to take into account the possibility
                        that we Americans are just goddamned fools.’”</p>
                    <p>Now, I say that because the constant, overriding preoccupation with my
                        father, President Kennedy, President Johnson, Robert McNamara, that whole
                        group, was how do we avoid World War Three in a nuclear age? And writing 20
                        years later, Pop writes about Vietnam, “In Vietnam, the decisive issue was
                        the fidelity of the United States to collective security and its treaty
                        commitments and the implications of that fidelity for world peace.” He was
                        not an admirer of the SEATO treaty. During the Truman Administration, when
                        Pop was Assistant Secretary of State for the Far East, he had opposed
                        entering into any collective security agreement in Southeast Asia involving
                        any great powers. That was an accomplishment of John Foster Dulles, with the
                        aid of Mike Mansfield as the principal Senate sponsor, 1955.</p>
                    <p>But by 1961, South Vietnam had been added to that list of nations to whom we
                        had collective security commitments in that respect, and they felt that it
                        was vital for us to honor that. And writing again 20 years later, after my
                        dad had left office, he said, “Because Vietnam ended badly for American
                        policy, an architect of that policy such as myself is not the best one to
                        assess whatever good might have come from our commitment to Southeast Asia.
                        But even so, other capitals remember that the United States of America went
                        halfway around the world, sacrificed nearly 60,000 dead, hundreds of
                        thousands of wounded, and vast resources to meet its commitment to a small
                        country. We did ‘take steps to meet the common danger’ as we pledged to do
                        to those protected by SEATO if they were attacked. I suspect that leaders in
                        other capitals, when contemplating fresh adventures, might say, ‘Now, wait a
                        minute, comrades. We’ve got to be a little careful here, because those damn
                        fool Americans just might do something about it.’ If future events ever lead
                        to a conviction that the United States will not respond to acts of
                        aggression, the world would face risks to peace more severe than we’ve ever
                        seen.”</p>
                    <p>It’s now 2010. It’s16 years since our dad passed away. It is 65 years since a
                        nuclear weapon was fired off against another society, 65 years since
                        Nagasaki. We have seen the Soviet bloc fall apart. We’ve seen the
                        dissolution of the Soviet Union. We have not seen another attack by a – by
                        any country against a nation under the shield of our collective security
                        agreements since Vietnam itself. In terms of the objective that was
                        expressed here on many occasions and by many panelists about our role in
                        Vietnam, that is to maintain an independent, viable, noncommunist South
                        Vietnam, we failed. But in the larger context of 2010, in a world that is
                        incomparably safer from the threat of nuclear holocaust, was the Vietnam War
                        really a failure? That’s something really worth examining by this
                        context.</p>

                <p>The conference will take place in the George C. Marshall Conference Center at the
                    Department of State in Washington, D.C. and will serve three purposes. It will
                    showcase and commemorate the work of the Historian’s Office in documenting
                    United States policy in Southeast Asia in the Foreign Relations of the United
                    States (FRUS) series in over 24,000 pages of documents; and it will
                    provide—through participants’ papers, presentations, and panels—a full-scale
                    examination/re-examination of United States policy, beginning with the Indochina
                    War (1946-1954), continuing through the American periods of advice and support
                    (1955-1964) and intervention (1965-1973), and ending with the Fall of Saigon
                    (1975). Finally, the conference will explore the relationship between force and
                    diplomacy in both the prosecution of the war and the peace negotiations.
                    Proposals on the post-1975 era leading to “normalization” will be considered but
                    the conference will focus on the period of greatest American involvement.</p>
                <p>The first day’s program will include the following: a keynote address by a senior
                    official of the Department of State; a roundtable discussion by Kennedy,
                    Johnson, and Nixon-Ford Administration policy advisors on Vietnam; presentations
                    by scholars from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; and a panel of presentations
                    by senior scholars of the War. The second day’s program will consist of a series
                    of panels where academic and independent scholars will present papers on
                    topics/themes related directly or indirectly to American policy in Indochina
                    from 1946 to 1975.</p>
                <p>Those interested in submitting proposals should keep in mind that the Program
                    Committee will be more likely to form panels by historical period than by theme,
                    but the latter will be considered.</p>
                <p>To achieve the above objectives, the Program Committee welcomes proposals for
                    original papers/panels dealing with, but not limited to, the following
                    topics:</p>

                            those airports is quite steep (approx. $60-$70 from IAD; approx.
                            $90-$100 from BWI).</p>
